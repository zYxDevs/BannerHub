### [branch / pre-release] — Vibration preload-free + x86-64/Box64 launch-death fix (2026-05-16)
**Branch:** `fix/vibration-preload-free` (off `main`, NOT merged)  |  **Commits:** `c17e6a975` (original preload-free port), `b4e725570` (CI sed fix), `2e7009403` (adopt TideGear PR #91 controller)  |  **Build:** build-quick.yml CI run [25964048570](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25964048570) ✅ — artifact-only (no GH release per pre-release policy)

#### Headline
Fixes the v3.7.0 vibration regression that killed **every x86-64 / Box64 game launch** (Dead Cells the repro, PuBG variant `com.tencent.ig`, Proton 10 x64 + Box64-0.4.1-2 "Extreme"). v3.7.0's rumble feature LD_PRELOAD'd `libevshim.so` into Wine; on Box64 its in-memory winebus patcher corrupted the dynarec → ~60s CPU spin → `com.tencent.ig:wine has died`. arm64x+FEX containers were never affected.

#### Fix architecture (preload-free)
Removes `libevshim.so` / LD_PRELOAD entirely — nothing extra is mapped into Wine, so the crash class is eliminated. `BhVibrationController.ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Context)` (called via smali `invoke-static` at the `EnvironmentController.b` LD_PRELOAD anchor) scans the files tree and patches every `winebus.so` on disk so SDL2's ~1s rumble auto-expiry never fires:
- **aarch64-unix:** `ldur w3,[x29,#-0x14]; blr x8` → `mov w3,#-1; blr x8`
- **x86_64-unix (Box64):** wildcarded 11-byte call-site (`mov ecx,[rbp+disp8]; movzwl si; movzwl dx; call *rax`); the 3-byte duration load → `or ecx,-1` (`83 C9 FF`) → duration `0xFFFFFFFF`. `movzwl` pair discriminates vs the rumble-*stop* sites so those are untouched.
- **Fail-safe:** on a pattern miss the binary is *dumped* to `<externalFilesDir>/winebus_dump_x86_64.so`, never corrupted — worst case is no sustained rumble on that Proton, never a broken launch.

This is what gives x86_64 Wine containers sustained rumble for the first time (the old libevshim path was aarch64-only — x86_64 Wine silently rejected the arm64 .so, so SDL's 1s expiry fired).

#### What was applied from TideGear PR #91
[The412Banner/BannerHub#91](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/pull/91) "Make Vibration Fix Compatible With x86_64 Containers" — the canonical, self-contained successor to the original port. `extension/BhVibrationController.java` replaced **byte-for-byte** with PR #91's (commit `2e7009403`). All 5 smali injection signatures verified identical (`onRumble(III)Z`, `dispatchToController(III)Z`, `onStop(I)V`, `scheduleWakeup(Ljava/lang/Object;I)V`, `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Landroid/content/Context;)V`), pkg `com.xj.winemu.vibration` — wire-compatible with existing injection points. Removed dead `scripts/patch_winebus_rumble_duration.py` (patcher is now fully in Java) and unreferenced `native/evshim/`. **Workflows deliberately NOT taken from PR #91** — its head is TideGear's stale fork-main; wholesale adoption would clobber unrelated GOG/FrameGen patch steps and reintroduce a `/`-delimiter sed bug. Our branch's workflows already implement PR #91's exact preload-free mechanism off current `main`.

#### CI bug fixed (`b4e725570`)
`build.yml` "Inject BH_VERSION" step used `/` as the `sed` delimiter — broke on any branch name containing `/` (`sed: unknown option to 's'`), which is why the prior full build failed. Switched to `|` (build-quick.yml already correct). Pre-existing, unrelated to vibration.

#### Branch cleanup
`fix/evshim-box64-guard` (single commit `79c859772`, the superseded in-shim `EM_X86_64` guard — crash stops but no Box64 rumble; never merged) **deleted** from origin + local at user's instruction. Unmergeable anyway since the preload-free branch deletes the `evshim.c` it patched. SHA recorded in memory as a historical pointer only.

#### Device verification — ✅ CONFIRMED 2026-05-16
Artifact `/storage/emulated/0/Download/bh-vib-pf/BannerHub-fix-vibration-preload-free-Normal.apk` (~138 MB; "Normal" is build-quick's label, manifest patched to `com.tencent.ig` PuBG). Installed; multiple titles launched fine:

| Game | gameId | Container | Path | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dead Cells | 10417 | `proton10.0-x64-1` | Box64-0.4.1-2 "Extreme" (`isArm64X=false`) | ✅ fine |
| ULTRAKILL | 72090 | `proton9.0-x64-3` | Box64-0.4.1-2 "Extreme" (`isArm64X=false`) | ✅ fine |
| DOOMBLADE | 63362 | `proton10.0-arm64x-2` | FEX (`isArm64X=true`) | ✅ fine (FEX negative control — no collateral regression) |

Two **distinct** x86_64/Box64-"Extreme" titles (the exact regression config: x86_64 Proton + Box64-0.4.1-2 + `strongMem=0,weakBarrier=0,bigBlock=2`) launch cleanly where v3.7.0 spun box64 ~60s then `:wine has died`. Corroboration via root logcat-bridge: `.bh_winedevice_ready` rewritten per launch (delayed post-env-builder write **completing** = box64 lived past the old ~5s kill window; latest 10:40 `pid=31069`); **no** `winebus_dump_x86_64.so` anywhere (x86_64 winebus pattern matched on both proton9 & proton10 x64 winebus.so); zero crash/SIGSEGV/wine-died in any log (only the known broken-diag-HAL tombstone noise, never the cause). Rumble-feel/sustained-hold not yet log-verified (games reported running fine). **Ready for stable promotion on user's go** (per stable-release checklist + pre-release policy).

### [stable] — v3.7.2 — Hotfix: stub launch-time auto-update dialog (2026-05-12)
**Tag:** `v3.7.2`  |  **Build:** `build.yml` triggered on stable tag, head of `main` after merge of `feature/stub-launch-upgrade-dialog` (`3575b15`)  |  **Branches merged:** `feature/stub-launch-upgrade-dialog` (merge `543c2d0` into main, 2026-05-12)  |  **Release:** auto-published by build.yml

#### Headline
Hotfix for v3.7.1. No new features. Promotes the device-confirmed launch-time auto-dialog stub to a stable release across all 9 APK variants.

The auto-fired upgrade dialog that pops on app launch no longer probes GameHub's upgrade endpoint either. v3.7.1 only stubbed the Settings → About → Check Update *row*; the auto-dialog fires through a separate code path (`ApkUpdateUtils.checkUpdate` → `ApkUpdateUtils$checkUpdate$1$1.invokeSuspend`) that still hit the live upgrade endpoint on every launch and offered users an upgrade to stock GameHub 6.0.1 (`versionCode 110`). v3.7.2 closes that second mouth.

#### Why hotfix
- v3.7.1 closed one of two surfaces. The Settings row was the *manual* probe; the launch-time auto-dialog is the *automatic* probe and ran on every cold start.
- All 9 BannerHub variants stay on `versionCode 78` permanently for Steam-card visibility — upstream `versionCode 110` will always look like an available upgrade to this code path.
- The fix is one extra 5-instruction smali anchor-patch in the same shape as v3.7.1 (same `AppUpgradeRepo.b()` singleton, same `const/4 p1, 0x0` substitution, different inner class). No behavior change for any other surface. Worth shipping immediately rather than waiting on the next feature train.

#### Patch
`smali_classes6/com/xj/landscape/launcher/utils/ApkUpdateUtils$checkUpdate$1$1.smali` — the suspend invocation `invoke-virtual ... AppUpgradeRepo->b(I, Continuation)` plus its `move-result-object p1` is replaced with `const/4 p1, 0x0`, so the suspend resumes with a null `ApkUpdateEntity`. `ApkUpdateUtils.e()` already null-checks at line 336 (`if-eqz p1, :cond_2`) and returns without invoking the dialog — well-defined null path, no crash, no dialog.

Anchor verified against `bannerhub-base-decoded/` (534 chars, 1 occurrence). Same python3 anchor-patch shape used by every other smali patch in `build.yml` and `build-quick.yml`. Path differs between workflows: `build.yml` patches `apktool_out_base/`, `build-quick.yml` patches `apktool_out/` (consistent with the rest of the prepare-vs-build job split — see v3.7.1 lesson).

#### What's preserved unchanged
- v3.7.1 stub-upgrade-check (Settings row) — still in place
- v3.7.0 AI Frame Generation menu + Vibration / Rumble
- v3.6.1 Epic Online Services Phase 1
- Every other endpoint (login, store, prices, achievements, Steam card)

#### Test plan (device)
1. Cold-start any v3.7.2 variant fresh — **expected:** no update dialog appears on app launch (previously: dialog offered stock GameHub 6.0.1 download)
2. Open Settings → About → Check Update — **expected:** unchanged from v3.7.1, reads "Already the latest version"
3. Launch Steam catalog — **expected:** card still visible (still on 5.3.5 base)

#### Surfaced as pre-release first
Earlier on `feature/stub-launch-upgrade-dialog`, build-quick.yml CI run [25696474905](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25696474905) ✅ produced the artifact-only pre-build (no GH release, workflow_dispatch). User device-tested → confirmed working → promoted to v3.7.2 stable.

### [docs] — AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md — § 3.7 disassembled 1.3.7 patch (2026-05-11)
**Commit:** `1d86a98` on `main`  |  **No build / no release**

#### What changed
Follow-up to commit `821e4be` (same day). Disassembled both libGameScopeVK.so binaries with `llvm-objdump` and isolated the exact 1.3.7 patch. Findings:

- **It's a behavioral change, not a defensive log.** Earlier wording in § 3.6 ("drop-in replacement, adds one failure-path log line") understated what's going on.
- **Patched function:** `DirectRendering::Present()` — `0x19548c` in 1.3.6, `0x1954dc` in 1.3.7 (source file `direct_rendering_client.cpp`).
- **What changed:** when `DirectRenderingClient::WriteImageIndex(idx)` returns 0 (compositor pipe dead / EPIPE / short-write):
  - 1.3.6: silently falls through to the same `xcb_present_pixmap` + `xcb_flush` fallback the disabled/bootstrap state uses → user sees a sudden FPS halving + likely visual artifacts but no stall, and no log.
  - 1.3.7: logs `D gamescope: DirectRendering: present failed, dropping frame` and skips the present entirely; the next `WriteImageIndex` retries. The `xcb_present_pixmap` fallback at `0x195540` is still reachable from the disabled/null/status-error path but no longer from a `WriteImageIndex` failure.
- **Policy:** consistency over availability. 1.3.6 fragmented the stream between two presenters mid-game; 1.3.7 keeps either-compositor-or-nothing semantics.
- **Byte accounting** for the +240 B delta is now exact:
  - `.text +160 B` = new log+drop block (10 ish instructions + 2 BLs + SSO branch + unwind to shared cleanup) and the retargeted branch
  - `.rodata +48 B` = the new 48-byte string `"DirectRendering: present failed, dropping frame\0"`
  - `.gcc_except_table +32 B` = one new unwind entry for the `std::string` temporary between ctor at `0x1955e8` and `operator delete` at `0x195604`
  - `.relro_padding −240 B` = loader gave back exactly what the other three sections gained (`160+48+32 = 240`)
- **Corrections to § 3.6:**
  - File diff: 7,799 entries / 6,801 regular files (the earlier "6,801 files" number was the regular-file slice)
  - Dynamic symbol count: 175 entries, `diff` empty (the earlier "39 dyn symbols" was an undercount from a partial subset)

#### Practical takeaway for BannerHub debugging
A burst of `DirectRendering: present failed, dropping frame` in a 1.3.7 user's logcat now specifically indicates compositor-pipe trouble — was invisible in 1.3.6 (silent fallback). Useful new diagnostic surface.

#### Files touched
- `AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md` (§ 3.6 corrections + new § 3.7)
- Memory: `project_imagefs_136_vs_old.md` updated with the patch detail; `MEMORY.md` index hook reworded

### [docs] — AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md — track imagefs 1.3.7 (2026-05-11)
**Commit:** `821e4be` on `main`  |  **No build / no release**

#### What changed
Documentation-only update to `AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md`. No code change, no APK rebuild.
- **§ 3.1 properties table**: added a 1.3.7 row — `libGameScopeVK.so` is now `2,219,144 B` (`+240 B` vs 1.3.6), BuildID `956f6693e9cca5587a2266737bc331a17be83f60`
- **§ 3.1 architecture line**: corrected "NDK r28-beta1" → "built by NDK r27 (12077973), targets Android 26" per the actual ELF metadata read off our local 1.3.6 copy
- **§ 3.1**: added BuildID rows for both 1.3.6 and 1.3.7
- **§ 3.5 diagnostic strings**: one new failure-path log line in 1.3.7 — `"DirectRendering: present failed, dropping frame"` (drops the synthetic frame when `vkQueuePresentKHR` / image-acquire fails, instead of whatever 1.3.6 did)
- **New § 3.6 firmware version history**: 4-row table covering pre-1.3.5 stub → 1.3.5 → 1.3.6 → 1.3.7, plus the end-to-end binary diff (`.text +160 B`, `.rodata +48 B`, `.gcc_except_table +32 B`, `.relro_padding −240 B`; 39 dynamic symbols unchanged; 6801 files in the imagefs and `libGameScopeVK.so` is the only substantive change)
- **§ 6.4 capability gating**: bumped the "1.3.5+" wording to explicitly cover 1.3.5/1.3.6/1.3.7 as behaviorally equivalent
- **§ 13 open issues**: added a firmware-tracker item noting three consecutive single-library bumps

#### Why
Memory entry `project_imagefs_136_vs_old.md` had the full 1.3.7 analysis from 2026-05-10 but the public report still referenced 1.3.6 as the latest. User flagged the gap.

#### Files touched
- `AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md`

### [stable] — v3.7.1 — Hotfix: stub the Settings → About → Check Update row (2026-05-10)
**Tag:** `v3.7.1`  |  **Build:** `build.yml` run [25644181499](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25644181499) ✅ on head `b8b95f4` (stable, all 9 variants)  |  **Branches merged:** `feature/stub-upgrade-check` (merge `33830b8` into main on 2026-05-09)  |  **Release:** https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/releases/tag/v3.7.1

#### Release-day note (2026-05-10/11)
First v3.7.1 tag (on `26dc8c6`) failed CI at "Apply Stub Upgrade Check smali patch" with `FileNotFoundError: apktool_out/...`. Root cause: `build.yml` line 133 used `apktool_out/` but every other smali patch in the same prepare job (ClientParams, TokenInterceptor, SettingBtnHolder, SettingItemEntity, GamepadServerManager, etc.) uses `apktool_out_base/` — the prepare job decompiles to `apktool_out_base/` and only the per-variant build job downstream operates on `apktool_out/`. Fixed in `b8b95f4`, v3.7.1 tag force-replaced, re-triggered build → succeeded, release published.

#### Headline
Hotfix for v3.7.0. No new features. Promotes the v3.7.1-pre1 device-confirmed patch to a stable release across all 9 APK variants.

The Settings → About → "Check Update" row no longer auto-fires `POST /upgrade/getAppUpgradeApk` against GameHub's official server. It now reads "Already the latest version" unconditionally and never probes upstream — closing the footgun where users on the 5.3.5/vc78 BannerHub base were being offered a stock GameHub 6.0.1/vc110 download (which would have replaced BannerHub with stock GameHub and broken the Steam-card pinning everything else in this fork depends on).

#### Why hotfix
- v3.7.0 still had the live upgrade probe — any user who opened Settings → About after install saw a red "New" badge and a prompt that would have pulled stock GameHub from GameHub's CDN.
- All 9 BannerHub variants ship `versionCode 78` permanently (Steam-card visibility depends on staying on the 5.3.5 base), so upstream `versionCode 110` is always going to look like an available upgrade to that row.
- The fix is a single 5-instruction smali patch — there is no behavior change for any other surface (login, store, prices, achievements, Steam card all unaffected). Worth shipping immediately rather than waiting on the next feature train.

#### Patch
See v3.7.1-pre1 entry below for the smali-level details. Same patch, same anchor — `smali_classes8/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/setting/holder/SettingUpgradeHolder$onBind$1$1.smali`, suspend call return value replaced with `const/4 p1, 0x0` so the `if-eqz p1` no-update branch is always taken.

#### Test plan (device)
1. Install any v3.7.1 variant fresh (or over a v3.7.0 install of the same variant — no certificate change)
2. Open app → Settings → About → "Check Update"
3. **Expected:** row is gray "Already the latest version", no red badge; tapping shows "You're already on the latest version" toast and never opens a download dialog
4. Logcat shows no `getAppUpgradeApk` traffic from `SignUtils clientparams` between launch and post-Settings-open

#### Notes
- Pre-release policy resumes: every build after v3.7.1 is artifact-only / no GH Release until the user explicitly calls "stable" again.
- No README feature section needed; FAQ entry added explaining the new Check Update behavior.

### [pre-release] — v3.7.1-pre1 — Stub the Settings → About → Check Update row (2026-05-09)
**Tag:** `v3.7.1-pre1`  |  **Branch:** `feature/stub-upgrade-check`  |  **Workflow:** `build-quick.yml` (Normal variant only, artifact-only per pre-release policy)

#### Why
Upstream GameHub now ships **6.0.1 / versionCode 110**. Every BannerHub variant on the 5.3.5 base ships **versionCode 78**. The Settings → About → "Check Update" row auto-fires `POST /upgrade/getAppUpgradeApk` against GameHub's official server on bind, which now returns a non-empty `ApkUpdateEntity` pointing at stock 6.0.1 GameHub. The row shows a red "New" badge and tapping it would attempt to download stock GameHub from GameHub's CDN — install fails on signature mismatch with the BannerHub keystore, but the prompt itself is wrong (claims "BannerHub update available" when it isn't).

#### Patch
One anchored find/replace in `smali_classes8/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/setting/holder/SettingUpgradeHolder$onBind$1$1.smali`. Replaces the 5-instruction `AppUpgradeRepo.getAppUpgradeApk()` suspend call (lines 365–382 of the base decompile) with a single `const/4 p1, 0x0` so the result is always `null`. Existing `if-eqz p1` checks in the same method then take the "no update" branch:
- Row text → "Already the latest version" (gray, no badge)
- Tap → toast: "You're already on the latest version" (existing fallback in the click handler's `:cond_1`)

No network probe ever fires. Steam-card visibility, login, store, prices, achievements — every other GameHub endpoint — completely untouched (those flow through the user-selected API as today).

#### Files
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml` — new "Apply Stub Upgrade Check smali patch" step, inserted after AppUtils phone-home patches
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — same step, same position (so stable build inherits when ready)

#### Test plan (device)
1. Sideload pre-release APK
2. Open app → Settings → About
3. **Expected:** "Check Update" row shows gray "Already the latest version" text, no red "New" badge
4. Tap the row → toast "You're already on the latest version", no dialog
5. Logcat should show **no** `SignUtils clientparams` line containing `is_active=2&...&versionCode=` between launch and post-Settings-open — i.e. no `/upgrade/getAppUpgradeApk` call

### [docs] — `VK_NV_optical_flow` on Adreno deep-dive report (2026-05-08)

Added a dedicated driver-nerd writeup explaining how Mesa Turnip reimplements the NV-prefixed Vulkan extension on Adreno, and what BannerHub 3.7.0's AI Frame Generation actually depends on at the driver layer.

- **New:** `gamehub_reports/VK_NV_OPTICAL_FLOW_ON_ADRENO.md` — 8 sections covering the per-chip dispatch (chip 6/7/8 templates), `libGameScopeVK.so` ICD shim internals (NEEDED list, `delta0..9` + `gamma0..4` + `gamma23` embedded compute pipelines, env-var config, ICD chaining via `GAMESCOPE_DRIVER_PATH`), end-to-end runtime chain diagram, silent-fail gate + verification recipe, and what BannerHub itself contributes vs what comes from imagefs.
- **Updated:** `AI_FRAME_GENERATION_REPORT.md` § 6 — replaced terse summary with expanded 6.1–6.5 subsections (chip table, NEEDED list, delta/gamma pipelines, "why this isn't hacking the API"). Added cross-ref to dedicated report.
- **Updated:** `gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_600_MASTER_MAP.md` § 26.8.6 — same expansion in-context, with pointer at the top to the dedicated report.

Source for all claims: direct symbol/string analysis of `imagefs_136.zst:usr/lib/{libGameScopeVK.so, libvulkan_freedreno.so}`. Cross-checked against `imagefs.zst` (older, pre-1.3.5) which ships a 950 KB `libGameScopeVK.so` stub with no AI codepath — confirms 3.7.0's frame-gen requires 1.3.5+ firmware.

### [stable] — v3.7.0 — In-game AI Frame Generation menu + PC-accurate Vibration / Rumble (2026-05-09)
**Tag:** `v3.7.0`  |  **Build:** `build.yml` (stable, all 9 variants)  |  **Branches merged:** `feature/framegen-menu` (--no-ff merge `9d4a594`) + PR #80 from `TideGear:Fix-Vibration` (merge `fb50345`)  |  **Release:** https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/releases/tag/v3.7.0

#### Headline
Two new user-facing features over v3.6.1:
1. **In-game AI Frame Generation menu** (originally v3.7.0-pre1, 2026-05-08) — sidebar entry + dialog for GameHub 6.0.1's built-in `libGameScopeVK` frame interpolation. 6 presets, 2×/3×/4× multiplier, 0.20–1.00 flow scale. Confirmed ~1.8–1.9× FPS scaling on device (42 → 75/80 FPS via overlay screenshots).
2. **PC-accurate Vibration / Rumble** (originally v3.7.0-pre2, 2026-05-09) — XInput-shaped Wine controller rumble routed into Android's `VibratorManager`. Independent low/high motors on dual-motor pads, sustained holds (LD_PRELOAD shim defeats SDL2's 1s rumble expiration), instant release, multi-controller auto-wake up to 4 slots, Samsung HAL workaround, per-game **PC Vibration Settings** popup-menu entry. From TideGear's PR #80, originally landed on GameNative as PR #1214.

#### What shipped (cumulative across pre1–pre2 over v3.6.1)

**In-game AI Frame Generation menu (pre1)**
- New `extension/BhFrameGenSettings.java`, `BhFrameGenWriter.java`, `BhFrameGenDialog.java`, `BhFrameGenWiring.java` — programmatic Dialog (no XML, avoids R.id cross-module coupling), mmap byte writer for `gamescope.control`, persisted SharedPrefs.
- Smali hooks: `SidebarControlsFragment.onResume()` → `BhFrameGenWiring.bind(View)`; `WineActivity.onCreate()` → `BhFrameGenWriter.applyFromPrefsNoContext()` to re-apply settings before Wine starts (works around BannerHub's regenerator zeroing byte 0 every launch).
- ICD JSON written at runtime using `ctx.getPackageName()`, so menu works on any installed APK package name (including manually-renamed APKs).
- Master map § AI-FrameGen documents the full implementation.

**PC-accurate Vibration / Rumble (pre2, PR #80)**
- New `extension/BhVibrationController.java` — singleton dispatcher hooked into `GamepadServerManager.onRumble`, `GamepadDevice$Physical.h/g`, `GamepadManager.B0`, EnvironmentController.
- New `extension/BhVibrationSettingsActivity.java` — Mode/Intensity dialog. Compact landscape layout with ScrollView capped at 85% screen height.
- New `native/evshim/evshim.c` + `CMakeLists.txt` — Wine-side LD_PRELOAD shim that patches `winebus.so`'s `pSDL_JoystickRumble` + `pSDL_JoystickClose` `.bss` pointers, re-issues `SDL_JoystickRumble` every 500ms with 2s duration so SDL2's 1s `rumble_expiration` never fires mid-hold.
- Multi-controller auto-wake via synthetic button-14 flicker through `GamepadServerManager.g`, gated on `Physical`-only with 200ms per-slot stagger.
- Samsung Vibrator HAL workaround: 1ms supersede pulse before `VibratorManager.cancel()`.
- Per-game settings stored in stock `pc_g_setting<gameId>` SharedPreferences under `bh_vibration_*` keys → existing Export/Import Config flow picks them up automatically.
- Master map § Vibration-Rumble documents the full implementation.

#### What is NOT in this release
- **EOS Phase 2** (in-game Epic friends popup / notifications UI). Was attempted on `epic-eos-phase2` branch, scrubbed 2026-05-08 — Phase 1 auth shipped in v3.6.1 already covers online multiplayer / friends / leaderboards / matchmaking, the Phase 2 overlay is purely cosmetic UI chrome.
- **Per-game frame-gen settings.** Frame Generation settings are global in v1; per-game scoping is a v2 candidate.
- **DirectInput rumble.** Vibration covers the XInput API path only; DInput games (rare today) bypass our hook.

#### Disclaimers (release-notes "Note for upgraders" content)
1. **Frame Generation requires Adreno GPU.** GameHub 6.0.1's frame interpolation engine uses `VK_NV_optical_flow`, which on Android is currently only exposed by Qualcomm Adreno drivers. The menu controls work everywhere but the actual frame interpolation is silently skipped on non-Adreno GPUs (Mali, Xclipse, etc.).
2. **Vibration is XInput-only.** Modern PC games using XInput (the standard) get full rumble. The handful of older or niche titles that use the DirectInput Force-Feedback API bypass our hook entirely and won't rumble.
3. **Native-XInput controllers need Bluetooth for rumble.** DualSense and DualShock 4 rumble fine over USB and Bluetooth. Xbox-style pads and 8BitDo controllers in XInput mode rumble over Bluetooth but NOT over USB — Android's USB-HID driver for XInput devices doesn't expose the rumble feature report path. Workaround: connect those controllers via Bluetooth.

#### Post-release doc trail (no APK rebuild — release body edited via `gh release edit`)
- `63d4b07` — added `gamehub_reports/GAMEHUB_600_MASTER_MAP.md` (3,040-line GameHub 6.0.0 → 6.0.1 reverse-engineering report) to the repo and expanded README's AI Frame Generation Menu section with how-it-works, expanded settings dialog table, practical guidance, persistence model, caveats. Linked § 26.8 of the new report from the README for the deep technical dive.
- `0cf7d81` — credited the GameHub team for the AI frame interpolation engine (`libGameScopeVK`, `VK_NV_optical_flow` Adreno path, optical-flow synthesis pipeline, 6 quality presets) in both the README's frame-gen section and the release body, mirroring the GameNative Phase-1 credit style from v3.6.1 and the TideGear vibration credit in this release.
- `129258e` — dropped FPS-limit references from README + master map + PROGRESS_LOG + release body + Reddit post + memory. The FPS-limit UI was scaffolded in `55308ab` but removed in `5a9ab56` ("remove FPS section"); bytes 0–1 of `gamescope.control` stay owned by GameHub's separate sidebar FPS-limit control. README now points users at that existing GameHub control instead.
- Reddit announcement post drafted at `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/BannerHub-v3.7.0-reddit-post.txt` with full credits, repo links, README anchors, and "My other projects" section (Banners-Turnip, winlator-contents).

### [pre] — v3.7.0-pre2 — Add PC-accurate Vibration / Rumble support (2026-05-08)
**PR merged:** [#80](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/pull/80) from `TideGear:Fix-Vibration` (merge commit `fb50345`)  |  **Tag:** `v3.7.0-pre2`  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (artifact-only)  |  **Variant:** Normal on `com.tencent.ig`

#### Why
PC games on Wine expect XInput-shaped rumble (`XInputSetState(slot, low, high)`). The stock `GamepadServerManager.onRumble` chokepoint in GameHub doesn't drive Android's vibrators, so games either get no rumble or auto-stopped rumble (SDL2's internal 1s `rumble_expiration` cuts the motor while the game is still holding it). PR #80 routes the existing chokepoint through Android's `VibratorManager` + a Wine-side LD_PRELOAD shim that re-issues `SDL_JoystickRumble` every 500ms with a 2s duration so sustained holds survive.

#### What shipped (cumulative on top of v3.7.0-pre1)
- All v3.7.0-pre1 content (in-game AI Frame Generation menu — framegen sidebar entry + dialog, runtime ICD JSON write).
- **PR #80 (vibration / rumble)** — full XInput-shaped controller rumble for Wine games:
  - Independent low/high motor control on dual-motor pads via `CombinedVibration.startParallel`; single-motor blend (`low*0.80 + high*0.33`) fallback on 1-motor devices and the phone vibrator.
  - Sustained holds via guest-side `libevshim.so` LD_PRELOAD shim — patches `winebus.so`'s SDL function pointers (no PLT/GOT relocation; `pSDL_JoystickRumble` + `pSDL_JoystickClose` in `.bss`) and re-issues rumble every 500ms with 2s duration.
  - Instant release on let-go (no phantom-suppression timer).
  - Multi-controller auto-wake — synthetic button-14 flicker through `GamepadServerManager.g` triggers libvfs's lazy `SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED` so freshly-connected controllers rumble without requiring any button press. Staggered 200ms per slot ascending so 3+ controller setups register cleanly.
  - Wake-up hook gated on `GamepadDevice$Physical` only — skips `$Virtual` (touch overlay) so toggling Touch Controls or launching with no real controller doesn't crash with "Virtual gamepad already exists in slot 0".
  - Samsung Vibrator HAL workaround — 1ms minimum-amplitude supersede pulse before `VibratorManager.cancel()`.
  - Per-game **PC Vibration Settings** dialog (Mode: Off / Controller / Device / Both, Intensity slider) inserted right after "PC Game Settings" in the popup options menu. Settings stored in stock `pc_g_setting<gameId>` SharedPreferences under `bh_vibration_*` keys so existing `BhSettingsExporter` Export/Import flow picks them up automatically.

#### Files added / changed by PR #80
| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `extension/BhVibrationController.java` | Singleton dispatcher hooked from smali into the gamepad pipeline (rumble entry, non-zero dispatch, stop hook, connect hook for auto-wake, EnvironmentController LD_PRELOAD prepend) |
| `extension/BhVibrationSettingsActivity.java` | Mode/Intensity dialog (compact landscape layout, ScrollView capped at 85% screen height) |
| `native/evshim/evshim.c` + `CMakeLists.txt` | Wine-side LD_PRELOAD shim — patches `winebus.so` SDL pointers, `pthread_atfork` child handler for fork-no-exec survival, PT_GNU_RELRO-aware page perms, gated to processes that load `winebus.so`, writes winedevice ready marker for Java-side wake-up sequencing |
| `patches/AndroidManifest.xml` | Registers `BhVibrationSettingsActivity` |
| `patches/smali/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/gamedetail/BhVibrationLambda.smali` | Function1 stub for popup option launch with resolved `gameId` + game name extras |
| `.github/workflows/build*.yml` | NDK build step for `libevshim.so` + anchor-based Python regex smali patches at `apktool b` time covering `GamepadServerManager.onRumble`, `GamepadDevice$Physical.h/g`, `GamepadManager.B0` (with null + instanceof Physical guards), `GameDetailSettingMenu.W` popup option insertion (with name-based "PC Game Settings" search and tail-append fallback for non-English locales), and EnvironmentController LD_PRELOAD prepend |

#### Scope and limitations (from PR description)
- **XInput API path only.** DirectInput games (HID Force-Feedback feature reports through `dinput8.dll`) bypass `GamepadServerManager.onRumble` entirely. Almost no modern PC game is DInput-only for rumble, but it's worth noting.
- **USB vs Bluetooth for rumble depends on the controller.** DualSense and DS4 rumble fine over USB and BT. Native-XInput controllers (8BitDo Pro 2 in XInput mode, Xbox-style pads) rumble over Bluetooth but NOT over USB — Android's USB-HID driver for XInput devices doesn't expose the rumble feature report path the way the BT HID profile does. Workaround: connect XInput-mode pads via Bluetooth.

#### Pre-merge test status
PR #80 was test-built on branch `test/vibration-pr80` (CI run 25531977830 ✅, 2026-05-08), merged onto pre-framegen main. Author-tested on Samsung with DualSense + DS4 + 8BitDo Pro 2 across single, dual, and triple-controller setups; sustained holds, instant release, taps, and post-connect wake-up confirmed; triple-controller staggered slot-0 → slot-1 → slot-2 wake-up at +0/+200/+400ms validated via logcat. Touch Controls toggle and zero-controller launch crashes confirmed fixed.

This v3.7.0-pre2 build is the first integration test of vibration on top of the framegen menu (pre1).

### [pre] — v3.7.0-pre1 — In-game AI Frame Generation menu (2026-05-08)
**Branch merged:** `feature/framegen-menu` (--no-ff into main, merge commit `9d4a594`)  |  **Tag:** `v3.7.0-pre1` on the merge commit  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (artifact-only — no GitHub Release per pre-release policy)  |  **Variant:** Normal on `com.tencent.ig` (pre/beta isolation package)

#### Note on prior v3.7.0-pre1
The earlier `v3.7.0-pre1` tag (EOS Phase 2 sub-phases 2A–2F overlay work, originally on commit `fabbc67`) was deleted from origin and locally on 2026-05-08. EOS Phase 2 has been scrubbed and will not be carried forward. The `v3.7.0-pre1` label is now reused for this framegen pre-release. The `epic-eos-phase2` branch was also deleted on 2026-05-08; the Phase 2 commits are now unreachable from any ref and will be garbage-collected by git in due course.

#### Why
First user-facing surface for the in-game AI Frame Generation feature added in v3.6.x research. Users can now toggle frame generation, pick a preset, set a multiplier, and tune flow scale from a sidebar entry without manually editing `gamescope.control` or the ICD JSON. Settings survive BannerHub's `gamescope.control` regenerator (which zeros byte 0 every launch) via a smali hook in `EnvironmentController.smali` that re-applies the saved values on each game launch.

#### What shipped (6 commits, ordered)
1. `55308ab` — initial scaffolding: in-game AI Frame Generation settings menu
2. `0e214de` — move launch hook from classes6 to classes15 (correct dex slot for `WineActivity.onCreate` post-6.0.1 letter remap)
3. `5a9ab56` — drive sidebar switch via `setSwitch()` reflection; remove FPS section
4. `12195fc` — dock settings dialog to right edge, vertically centered
5. `902ec82` — compact dialog layout (320dp wide, smaller text + paddings)
6. `7af2a70` — write `GameScopeVK_icd.json` with runtime package name (`ctx.getPackageName()`); makes the ICD JSON path correct on first launch with no manual edit, and works for any installed package name including manually-renamed APKs

#### Files added
| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `extension/BhFrameGenSettings.java` | Settings + 6-preset enum |
| `extension/BhFrameGenWriter.java` | mmap byte writer (per-byte + full + `applyFromPrefsNoContext()` for smali hook); also writes `GameScopeVK_icd.json` per-package |
| `extension/BhFrameGenDialog.java` | Programmatic dialog UI (no XML — avoids R.id cross-module coupling) |
| `extension/BhFrameGenWiring.java` | Binds sidebar widgets via `getResources().getIdentifier()` |
| `patches/smali_classes14/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/SidebarControlsFragment.smali` | onResume hook → `BhFrameGenWiring.bind(getView())` |
| `patches/smali_classes6/com/winemu/core/controller/EnvironmentController.smali` | Tail of `n()` method → `BhFrameGenWriter.applyFromPrefsNoContext()` |
| `patches/res/layout/winemu_sidebar_controls_fragment.xml` | Adds `frame_gen_container` row |
| `patches/res/values/ids.xml` | + `frame_gen_container`, `switch_frame_gen`, `btn_frame_gen_settings` |
| `patches/res/values/strings.xml` | + `bh_framegen_title`, `bh_framegen_settings_open` |
| `BANNERHUB_MASTER_MAP.md` | § 286 corrected to 10-byte protocol; new § AI-FrameGen added |

#### Storage
- SharedPreferences file: `bh_framegen.xml`
- Global (not per-game) settings in v1
- Keys: `enabled`, `preset`, `multiplier`, `flowScale`, `model` (the FPS-limit UI was scaffolded but removed before pre1; bytes 0–1 of `gamescope.control` stay owned by GameHub's separate FPS-limit sidebar control)

#### Preset → byte mapping
| Preset | model | flowScale |
|---|---|---|
| ECO | 0 | 0.2 |
| FLOW | 0 | 0.4 |
| BAL | 0 | 0.6 (default) |
| BOOST | 0 | 0.8 |
| CLEAR | 1 | 0.6 |
| MAX | 1 | 0.8 |

#### Device test status (2026-05-08)
✅ Fresh install on a manually-renamed package (matches the `com.tencent.ig` path the build-quick.yml builds): user installed the build from CI run 25586514867, opened the in-game frame-gen menu, and confirmed activation works end-to-end. Earlier overlay screenshots (2026-05-08 20:30) had already shown 42 → 75 / 80 FPS (~1.8–1.9× on 2× multiplier) on the same code path.

#### Known caveats / pending
- Settings are global; per-game scoping is a v2 candidate
- Dialog is built programmatically with hardcoded English; localization TBD
- Master map § 26.8.4 notes that multiplier=1 is silently coerced to 2 at the IPC layer; multiplier=3/4 is documented but not yet observed working in our tests

### [stable] — v3.6.1 — Epic Online Services support (2026-05-05)
**Tag:** v3.6.1  |  **Build:** `build.yml` (stable, all 9 variants)  |  **Branch merged:** `epic-eos`  |  **CI:** [run 25395902373](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25395902373) ✅  |  **Release:** https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/releases/tag/v3.6.1

#### 🙏 Credit
This release is a Java port of the EOS work by The GameNative Team (https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative). Specifically based on **PR #1286 / commit `cbea7f7`** ("Feat/eos overlay utkarsh") — https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/commit/cbea7f70be46e6f4a99a7e92db13c9b96add9c1c — which introduced the launch-args, sidecar/deployment-ID fetch, and exchange-code auth flow we ported. Massive thanks to **utkarshdalal** and the GameNative contributors. Without their research and reverse-engineering of Epic's launcher protocols this feature wouldn't exist in BannerHub.

#### Phase 1 vs Phase 2
- **Phase 1 (this release)** — Online authentication. Games successfully authenticate to Epic Online Services for multiplayer / friends / leaderboards / matchmaking.
- **Phase 2 (still pending)** — In-game EOS overlay UI (Epic friends popup / notifications / achievement toasts via Shift+F3). Estimated 250-400 LOC + Wine prefix registry editor. Will land in a future BannerHub release. Multiplayer / online services / leaderboards / matchmaking all work without it; only the in-game UI chrome is missing.

#### What shipped (cumulative across pre1–pre5 over v3.6.0)

**Epic Online Services authentication (pre1–pre3)**
- New `BhEpicLaunchArgs.java` hooked into `WineHelper$Companion.b()` (smali patch). For Epic-installed games, appends `-EpicPortal`, `-epicusername=<displayName>`, `-epicuserid=<accountId>`, `-epicsandboxid=<namespace>`, `-epiclocale=en`, and the `-AUTH_LOGIN=unused -AUTH_PASSWORD=<exchangeCode> -AUTH_TYPE=exchangecode` triple. Silent no-op for non-Epic launches (Steam/GOG/Amazon/custom unaffected).
- New `BhEpicSidecar.java` — fetches a fresh Epic exchange code per launch via `account-public-service-prod03.ol.epicgames.com/account/api/oauth/exchange`. Exchange codes expire ~5 minutes so they must be fresh per launch (not cached). Also fetches deploymentId from Epic's manifest API and caches it (30-day TTL).
- Confirmed working on Fall Guys (device test): game launches, gets past "No exchange code was found" popup, reaches main menu authenticated to EOS.

**EOS visibility UX (pre4–pre5)**
- New `BhEpicEosDetector.java` — recursively scans an installed game's directory for EOS marker files (`EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll`, `EOSSDK-Win32-Shipping.dll`, `EOSOVH-Win64-Shipping.dll`, `EOSBootstrapper.exe`).
- Blue (`0xFF2962FF`) "EOS" pill rendered on `EpicGameDetailActivity` title row + `EpicGamesActivity` library tiles for games with the cached flag.
- Auto-scan triggered at install completion + lazy-scan on detail-page open for upgraders' previously-installed games.
- Bulk-scan wired into Epic library refresh (↺) button: 3-thread pool, skip-already-scanned, toast feedback ("Scanning N games for EOS…" → "EOS scan: M of N games use Epic Online Services").

#### What is NOT in this release
- **Phase 2 (in-game EOS overlay)** — the Epic friends popup / notifications UI. Cosmetic; deferred. Some games may need it for full feature parity but auth/multiplayer works without it.
- **Mono / Gecko / mscoree.dll in containers** — .NET-based games will still hit a missing-mscoree wall after auth succeeds. Fall Guys works because Unity ships its own runtime; other titles vary.
- **Third-party launcher dependencies** (e.g. Kongregate's `kartridge-sdk.dll` in Firestone, Ubisoft Connect in Brawlhalla) — these games may still fail to fully connect even with EOS auth working. Out of scope.

#### Disclaimers (release-notes "Note for upgraders" content)
1. **EOS coverage scope.** This release adds Epic Online Services authentication for online multiplayer / friends / leaderboards in EOS-integrated Epic games. The EOS in-game overlay (friend popup) is NOT included — games still authenticate and play online; you just don't get the in-game friends UI.
2. **Some Epic games have non-EOS dependencies.** Brawlhalla bundles Ubisoft Connect; Firestone bundles Kongregate's launcher SDK. These games may still fail to connect to their backends even with EOS auth working. This is unrelated to Epic / EOS — they need their respective third-party launchers running.
3. **Pre-existing Epic installs auto-detect.** Tap the Epic library ↺ refresh button once and BannerHub will scan all your installed Epic games for EOS markers and apply the blue "EOS" badge automatically. No reinstall needed.

### [pre] — v3.6.1-pre5 — EOS bulk-scan on Epic refresh (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `epic-eos`  |  **Tag:** `v3.6.1-pre5` on commit `fa801f4`  |  **CI:** [run 25393695167](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25393695167) ✅  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.6.1-pre5` (135 MB)

#### Why
pre4's lazy-on-detail-page-open scan covers individual games but doesn't bulk-migrate upgraders. Wiring the same scan into the existing Epic library refresh (↺) button gives users a single touchpoint that scans every installed Epic game in one shot, bulk-populating badges without a separate UI element.

#### What changed
- **`EpicGamesActivity.scanInstalledForEos()`** — called at the end of `syncLibrary()` after the tile list is rendered. Enumerates every `bh_epic_prefs.epic_dir_<appName>` whose dir exists and hasn't been scanned, dispatches each through a fixed pool of **3 simultaneous background threads** (gentle-on-storage default).
- **Toast feedback:**
  - **Start:** `Scanning N games for EOS…` (only if N > 0; silent no-op when nothing to scan).
  - **Per-completion:** list re-renders live so badges pop in as scans finish, no whole-screen redraw.
  - **End:** `EOS scan: M of N games use Epic Online Services` once the last scan completes.
- **Skip-already-scanned:** `BhEpicEosDetector.hasBeenScanned` gates each game; repeated refreshes only do work for newly-installed or never-scanned games. Idempotent.

---

### [pre] — v3.6.1-pre4 — Blue "EOS" badge on Epic library + detail page (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `epic-eos`  |  **Tag:** `v3.6.1-pre4` on commit `641ad9f`  |  **CI:** [run 25392779521](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25392779521) ✅  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.6.1-pre4` (135 MB)

#### Why
Now that BannerHub authenticates EOS-integrated Epic games (pre3), users want a way to see at a glance which games will use that integration. A small blue "EOS" pill — same visual style as the existing storage badge — communicates "this game uses Epic Online Services" without any explanation needed.

#### What changed
- **New `extension/BhEpicEosDetector.java`** — recursive scan of an installed game's directory for any of `EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll`, `EOSSDK-Win32-Shipping.dll`, `EOSOVH-Win64-Shipping.dll`, `EOSBootstrapper.exe`. Result cached in `bh_epic_prefs` as `epic_uses_eos_<appName>` + `epic_eos_scanned_<appName>`. Bounded at 50,000 files to prevent giant-install stalls. Provides `scan` (sync), `scanAsync` (background thread), `scanIfNeeded` (only if never scanned), and `isEosCached` (read flag).
- **`BhDownloadService.runEpic`** — fires `BhEpicEosDetector.scanAsync` after install completion. New installs get the flag automatically.
- **`EpicGameDetailActivity`** — renders a blue (`0xFF2962FF`) "EOS" pill next to the title in the header when the cached flag is true. On `onCreate`, calls `refreshEosBadge()` which lazy-scans previously-installed games (pre-feature installs) so upgraders don't have to reinstall. Same badge style as the existing storage indicator: white bold `9f` text, padding `dp(6,2,6,2)`, corner radius `dp(10)`.
- **`EpicGamesActivity`** — same blue pill rendered on each library tile when the cached flag is true and the game is installed.

#### Behavior
- New Epic installs → scan runs at install completion, badge shows immediately on first list refresh and detail-page open.
- Pre-existing installs from older versions → on first detail-page open, lazy-scan runs in background, badge populates next time the activity is refreshed.
- Non-installed games → no badge (we have no install dir to scan).
- Non-EOS Epic games → scan completes, flag stays false, no badge.
- Tap on badge → no action (informational only, mirrors storage badge UX).

### [pre] — v3.6.1-pre3 — EOS exchange-code auth + diagnostic logging (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `epic-eos`  |  **Tag:** `v3.6.1-pre3` on commit `dfc5c6f`  |  **CI:** [run 25389420156](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25389420156) ✅  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.6.1-pre3` (135 MB)

#### Why
After pre2's verifier fix unblocked launches, Fall Guys (a real EOS-integrated game) loaded successfully but its in-game UI showed "Epic Games Account Error — No exchange code was found, please launch from the Epic Games Launcher." This is the canonical error when EOS-integrated games detect they were launched outside Epic's launcher: they expect a fresh, short-lived exchange code passed via `-AUTH_LOGIN/-AUTH_PASSWORD/-AUTH_TYPE` and refuse to authenticate without it. Pre1/pre2's args (`-EpicPortal`, `-epicusername`, `-epicuserid`, `-epicsandboxid`, `-epiclocale`, `-epicdeploymentid`) describe the session, but the AUTH triple proves the user is signed in.

#### What changed
- **New `BhEpicSidecar.fetchExchangeCodeSync(Context)`** — synchronous GET to `https://account-public-service-prod03.ol.epicgames.com/account/api/oauth/exchange` with the user's Epic bearer token. Parses the response's `code` field. Returns null on any failure (caller skips AUTH args). 8-second timeout. NOT cached — exchange codes expire ~5 minutes after issuance and must be fresh per launch.
- **`BhEpicLaunchArgs.maybeInject` extended** — after the existing args, fetch a fresh exchange code and append `-AUTH_LOGIN=unused`, `-AUTH_PASSWORD=<code>`, `-AUTH_TYPE=exchangecode`. Log line now reports presence of both deploymentId and exchangeCode for diagnostic purposes.
- **More diagnostic logging in `BhEpicLaunchArgs`** — entry log reports the incoming exePath; existing failure paths log warnings instead of silent no-op so we can verify the hook is firing.

#### What this does NOT fix (yet)
- Fall Guys's earlier "failed to initialize wine buffer helper" Wine-init crash — user worked around by switching to `RunFallGuys.exe` + older Turnip + DXVK 2.3.1-async. Game now reaches the in-game UI.
- Mono / Gecko / mscoree.dll for .NET-based games — no container ships these. Will block other titles eventually but Fall Guys runs without them.

---

### [pre] — v3.6.1-pre2 — Fix verifier-rejection crash from pre1 (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `epic-eos`  |  **Tag:** `v3.6.1-pre2` on commit `8339d69`  |  **CI:** [run 25384496898](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25384496898) ✅  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.6.1-pre2` (135 MB)

#### What broke in pre1
On-device test of pre1 with Brawlhalla + Fall Guys both crashed BannerHub. Logcat (captured via `getlog -b crash`) showed:
```
java.lang.VerifyError: Verifier rejected class com.winemu.core.WineHelper$Companion:
[0x4C] register v5 has type Conflict but expected Reference: java.lang.String
```
The verifier rejected the patched method, crashing on **any** Wine launch — not just Epic. Steam/GOG/Amazon also broken in pre1.

#### Root cause
Inside `WineHelper$Companion.b()`, p1 (= v5 with `.locals 4`) gets reassigned twice during the method:
1. With the String result of `WinUtils.a()` (DOS-form converted path)
2. Later with the int return of `p2.length()` (when checking for non-empty args)

Pre1's smali patch referenced `p1` at method end. ART's static verifier traces all code paths, and at the injection point can't prove a single type for v5 — so it flags "type Conflict" and refuses to load the class.

#### Fix in pre2
Two-part smali patch:
1. **Bump `.locals 4` → `.locals 5`** at method entry, and **save the original `p1` to a fresh local `v4`**: `move-object/from16 v4, p1`. The new local is single-typed (only assigned once), so the verifier accepts it.
2. **At method end, use `v4` instead of `p1`** in the `BhEpicLaunchArgs.maybeInject(...)` call.

Verified safe before applying: no literal `v5+` register references exist within method `b()` body — only p-notation, which the smali assembler remaps automatically when locals changes.

### [pre] — v3.6.1-pre1 — Epic Online Services Phase 1 (online auth) (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `epic-eos`  |  **Tag:** `v3.6.1-pre1` on commit `248e5b0`  |  **CI:** run [25380834999](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25380834999) ✅  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (pre-release, artifact-only)  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.6.1-pre1` (135 MB), expires 2026-06-04

#### Why
EOS-integrated Epic games (multiplayer-enabled titles, *Deliver At All Costs*, etc.) couldn't authenticate to Epic Online Services because BannerHub's Epic install path passed zero Epic-specific args to Wine. Modern EOS games hard-require these args or fail with "Failed to connect to the Epic Launcher". This is Phase 1 of the EOS port from GameNative upstream commit `cbea7f7` — covers online auth basics (Phase 2 = in-game overlay, deferred).

#### What changed
- **New `extension/BhEpicLaunchArgs.java`** — called from a smali patch at the chokepoint of GameHub's Wine launch flow. Looks up whether the launching exePath belongs to an Epic install (via `bh_epic_prefs.epic_dir_*`), and if so appends `-EpicPortal`, `-epicusername=<displayName>`, `-epicuserid=<accountId>`, `-epicsandboxid=<namespace>`, `-epiclocale=en`, and `-epicdeploymentid=<id>` (when cached). Path normalization handles DOS-form paths produced by GameHub's exePath conversion before our hook runs.
- **New `extension/BhEpicSidecar.java`** — Java port of upstream `EpicManager.fetchDeploymentId`. Calls Epic's manifest API (`launcher-public-service-prod06.ol.epicgames.com`), parses `elements[0].sidecar.config` (a JSON-encoded string) for `deploymentId`, caches in `bh_epic_prefs.epic_deployment_<appName>` with 30-day TTL. Both positive and negative results are cached.
- **`BhDownloadService.runEpic`** — at install kickoff, fires `BhEpicSidecar.refreshAsync` so the deploymentId is cached BEFORE the user's first launch. Fire-and-forget; if it fails, first launch happens without the deploymentId (graceful degradation — many EOS games still work without it).
- **Smali patch in `build.yml` + `build-quick.yml`** — injects `BhEpicLaunchArgs.maybeInject(p0, p1)` before `return-object p0` in `WineHelper$Companion.b()` (smali_classes5). This is the single chokepoint — every Wine launch (Steam, GOG, Epic, Amazon, Custom) flows through here, but our helper silently no-ops for non-Epic launches.

#### Architecture rationale
- **Why `WineHelper$Companion.b()` and not a different injection point?** It's the universal Wine-launch chokepoint, called once from `WineProgramLauncherKt.a()` which is called once from `ProgramController.smali:2401`. No alternative entry points exist in GameHub. Confirmed by greppable inspection of the unpacked GameHub APK smali tree.
- **Why no per-game decision point?** GameHub treats GOG/Epic/Amazon games as "imported PC games" — no Epic awareness in the launcher. The exePath is the only signal we have to identify Epic launches at the chokepoint.
- **Why fire-and-forget the sidecar fetch?** The chokepoint runs synchronously during Wine container start; doing a network call there would block the launch. The cache-warming happens at install time so first-launch reads are local.
- **Why not implement Phase 2 (overlay) here?** Phase 2 needs a Wine prefix registry editor + overlay DLL distribution. ~250 LOC additional. Defer until Phase 1 device-tested.

#### Pre-existing-installs limitation
Epic games installed before v3.6.0 don't have the per-game metadata (`epic_meta_namespace_<appName>`, etc.) needed to construct launch args. They'll launch without EOS auth, exactly as before. The user can reinstall to get full EOS support.

### [stable] — v3.6.0 — Storage decouple, CDN ranking, thread picker, downloads UX (2026-05-05)
**Tag:** v3.6.0  |  **Build:** `build.yml` (stable, all 9 variants)  |  **Branch merged:** `fix/store-storage-bannerhub-only`

#### What shipped (cumulative across pre1–pre4 over v3.5.0)

**Storage architecture (pre1)**
- SD-card toggle decoupled from Steam. New `bh_storage_pref` SharedPreferences file with `bh_use_custom_storage`, `bh_storage_path`, `bh_storage_migration_dialog_shown`. The "Save Store Games to External Storage (SD Card)" toggle now writes only to BannerHub's pref — Steam's `steam_storage_pref` is never touched.
- One-shot migration dialog on first GOG/Epic/Amazon library visit after upgrade, offering to switch Steam back to internal storage if the user previously had it on SD via the v3.5.0 toggle.
- Lazy seed of `bh_storage_pref` from legacy `steam_storage_pref` so existing installs keep resolving to the same paths.

**Epic CDN ranking (pre2)**
- New `CdnRankingUtils.java` — HEAD-probes Epic's manifest CDN URLs in parallel and reorders by latency before downloads start. Java port of GameNative upstream `e78d402`.
- Wired into both `EpicDownloadManager.parseManifestApiJson` and `EpicDownloadManager.install`. Cloudflare-skip filter preserved.

**Per-download thread-count picker (pre3)**
- New tappable "Download speed" row on the install confirmation dialog (Low=4 / Medium=8 / High=16 / Max=24 / Auto=cores). Default opens at **Low (4)** — conservative on CPU + battery.
- Centralized into `BhInstallConfirmDialog.java` — used by all 6 install entry points (3 list activities + 3 detail activities).
- All three managers got a `int threadCount` overload; old signatures retained as wrappers for DLC paths.
- `BhDownloadService.EXTRA_THREADS` plumbs the chosen count through the foreground service.

**Downloads-screen UX (pre4)**
- Active download cards in `BhDownloadsActivity` now show the colored store badge (GOG / Epic / Amazon) the entire time, not just after completion.
- Both active and completed cards are tappable — opens the appropriate `*GameDetailActivity`.
- `BhDownloadService` persists per-game launch metadata at install kickoff (Epic namespace/catalog/title; GOG title/image/dev/category/generation; Amazon title/entitlement/sku) so tap-to-open survives app restarts.
- Pre-existing installs (from before v3.6.0) don't have the metadata — graceful fallback to the store's main library.

**CI infrastructure**
- `build.yml` and `build-quick.yml`: sed delimiter switched to `|` for branch names containing `/`. APK filename and artifact upload name sanitize `/` → `-`.

#### Disclaimers (release-notes "Note for upgraders" content)
1. **Tap-to-open detail pages — pre-existing installs.** Games installed before v3.6.0 don't have the per-store metadata needed for tap-to-open. Tapping their cards opens the store's main library instead. New installs going forward have full support.
2. **SD-card toggle is BannerHub-only.** The toggle now affects only GOG/Epic/Amazon. Steam is not touched. A one-time prompt on first store visit asks whether to switch Steam back to internal storage if you had the toggle on previously. There is no separate Steam SD-card toggle in the BannerHub UI.
3. **Default download speed is Low (4 threads).** A new "Download speed" picker on the install dialog defaults to Low to be conservative. Bump it up for faster downloads on a fast network. Per-install only; every dialog opens fresh at Low.

### [pre] — v3.5.1-pre4 — + Downloads-screen store badge during DL + tap-to-open (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `fix/store-storage-bannerhub-only`  |  **Tag:** `v3.5.1-pre4` on commit `83a91c3`  |  **CI:** run [25377085187](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25377085187) ✅  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (pre-release, artifact-only)  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.5.1-pre4` (135 MB), expires 2026-06-04

#### Why
1. Cards in the in-app downloads manager (`BhDownloadsActivity`) only showed a colored store badge AFTER a download completed. While downloading, you couldn't tell at a glance whether a card was GOG/Epic/Amazon. Now the badge appears as soon as the download starts.
2. Cards weren't tappable. You couldn't navigate from a download row to that game's detail page; you had to back out and go through the store's library. Now both downloading and completed cards open the appropriate `*GameDetailActivity` on tap (existing buttons — Cancel / × / Launch / Uninstall — still work because Android dispatches taps to the topmost handler).

#### What changed
- `BhDownloadService` — new public getter `getStore(String gameId)` exposes the in-memory `gameStores` map.
- `BhDownloadService.run{Epic,Gog,Amazon}` — at install kickoff, persist enough metadata for tap-to-open to relaunch the detail page later. New keys:
  - GOG: `gog_meta_title_<id>`, `gog_meta_image_<id>`, `gog_meta_dev_<id>`, `gog_meta_category_<id>`, `gog_meta_generation_<id>` in `bh_gog_prefs`
  - Epic: `epic_meta_namespace_<appName>`, `epic_meta_catalog_<appName>`, `epic_meta_title_<appName>` in `bh_epic_prefs`
  - Amazon: `amazon_meta_title_<id>`, `amazon_meta_ent_<id>`, `amazon_meta_sku_<id>` in `bh_amazon_prefs`
- `BhDownloadsActivity.addRow` — now accepts a `String store` parameter. Renders the same colored pill badge as completed rows. New no-store overload looks up the store via `BhDownloadService.getStore(gameId)` for backwards-compat with existing callsites.
- `BhDownloadsActivity` — new `openDetailScreen(dlKey, store)` helper. Reads per-store metadata and builds the right Intent for each store. Falls back to launching the store's main activity if metadata is missing.
- Card click listener — both active and completed cards now call `openDetailScreen` on tap.

#### Disclaimer for next stable release
Pre-existing installs (from before v3.5.1) won't have the per-store metadata persisted, so tapping their completed cards will land on the store's main library rather than the specific detail page. New installs going forward have full tap-to-open support. This is by design; the alternative would have been a migration that re-fetches game data from each store's API on first run — not worth the complexity.

### [pre] — v3.5.1-pre3 — + Per-download thread-count picker (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `fix/store-storage-bannerhub-only`  |  **Tag:** `v3.5.1-pre3` on commit `c95b2c0`  |  **CI:** run [25375252865](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25375252865) ✅  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (pre-release, artifact-only)  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.5.1-pre3` (135 MB), expires 2026-06-04

#### Why
Game downloads were hardcoded to 8 parallel threads in all three stores — no way for users to dial down on slow networks/older phones or dial up on fast wifi. Per-download dialog rather than a global setting so users can choose game-by-game.

#### What changed
- New `extension/BhDownloadConfig.java` — preset constants (Low=4, Medium=8, High=16, Max=24, Auto=cores) + clamp helper. Default opens at **Low (4 threads)**.
- New `extension/BhInstallConfirmDialog.java` — centralized install-confirmation dialog showing install size, available space, and a tappable "Download speed" row that opens a single-choice picker. Async size-fetch hook so each store can supply its own size source.
- `BhDownloadService` — new `EXTRA_THREADS` int extra. Each `runEpic` / `runGog` / `runAmazon` reads it and passes through to the manager.
- Download manager method overloads added with `int threadCount`:
  - `GogDownloadManager.startDownload(...)` — old signature kept as wrapper, both Gen 2 (line ~344) and Gen 1 (line ~570) thread pools now use the value.
  - `EpicDownloadManager.install(...)` — old signature kept as wrapper, chunk pool uses the value.
  - `AmazonDownloadManager.install(...)` — old signature kept as wrapper, chunk pool uses the value (replaces hardcoded `MAX_PARALLEL`).
- All six install entry points wired to the dialog:
  - `GogGamesActivity.showInstallConfirm` (3 callsites)
  - `EpicGamesActivity.showInstallConfirm` (2 callsites)
  - `AmazonGamesActivity.showInstallConfirm` (2 callsites)
  - `GogGameDetailActivity.startInstall` → split into dialog + `launchInstallWithThreads(int)`
  - `EpicGameDetailActivity.startInstall` → same split, fetches size via `EpicApiClient.getInstallSize`
  - `AmazonGameDetailActivity.startInstall` → same split, fetches size via Amazon manifest.proto
- All `startViaService*` helpers in list activities accept threadCount and put it on the intent. Backwards-compat overloads keep DEFAULT_THREADS for any callsite that didn't pass one.

#### Notes / scope
- DLC install paths (call download managers directly, not via service) keep using `DEFAULT_THREADS` — no dialog. Out of scope.
- Per-install only — no global setting, no persistence between installs. Every dialog opens at Low.
- Behavior change for users who don't read the dialog: previous default was 8 (hardcoded), new default is 4. They'll see slower downloads unless they explicitly bump it.

### [pre] — v3.5.1-pre2 — Decouple SD-card toggle from Steam + Epic CDN ranking (2026-05-05)
**Branch:** `fix/store-storage-bannerhub-only`  |  **Tag:** `v3.5.1-pre2` on commit `05aac50`  |  **CI:** run [25368485394](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25368485394) ✅  |  **Build:** `build-quick.yml` (pre-release, artifact-only)  |  **Artifact:** `BannerHub-pre-v3.5.1-pre2` (135 MB), expires 2026-06-04
**Branch contains 7 commits ahead of main:** storage decouple (`4548c5a`), 4 CI fixes for `/`-in-branch-name (`ee877c5`, `caa486b`, `6ac7e04`, `fdae054`), Epic CDN ranking (`18641d6`), CDN ranking lambda-capture fix (`05aac50`), progress-log version bump (`9214711`).

#### Why (storage decouple)
v3.5.0's "Save Store Games to External Storage (SD Card)" toggle wrote into GameHub's native `steam_storage_pref`, so flipping it also moved Steam game installs to SD. The toggle is supposed to control GOG/Epic/Amazon only.

#### What changed (storage decouple)
- New BannerHub-only pref file `bh_storage_pref` (keys `bh_use_custom_storage`, `bh_storage_path`, `bh_storage_migration_dialog_shown`).
- `extension/BhStorageHelper.java` — new helper handles toggle apply (writes to `bh_storage_pref`), SD detection (same `GHL/` folder convention as GameHub).
- `extension/BhStorageMigration.java` — one-shot dialog on first store-activity launch after upgrade. If user had Steam-on-SD via the v3.5.0 toggle, offers "Switch Steam to internal" (clears `steam_storage_pref` keys) vs "Keep Steam on SD card". Always seeds `bh_storage_pref` from the legacy values first so existing GOG/Epic/Amazon installs stay reachable regardless of choice.
- `extension/BhStoragePath.java` — reads `bh_storage_pref`. Lazy-seeds from legacy keys on first read.
- `BhStorageToggleListener.smali` confirm path now calls `BhStorageHelper.applyToggle(ctx, newValue)` instead of `GameHubPrefs.handleSettingToggle(0x18, newValue)`. Steam's pref writes never happen.
- `GameHubPrefs.smali` — new `isBhCustomStorageEnabled()` method (mirrors `isCustomStorageEnabled` against `bh_storage_pref`, with self-seed on first read). `getInitialSwitchValue(0x18)` and `isSettingEnabled(0x18)` reroute to it so the visible toggle reflects BannerHub state, not Steam state.
- Game detail activities (GOG/Epic/Amazon) — storage badge reads from `bh_storage_pref`.
- Migration hooked into `GogMainActivity`, `EpicMainActivity`, `AmazonMainActivity` `onCreate`.

#### What is NOT changed (storage decouple)
- Toggle position, label, and confirmation-dialog wording untouched.
- GameHub's native Steam-storage smali (in `apktool_out_base/`) untouched. Steam continues to read `steam_storage_pref`. After migration, Steam either stays on SD (user chose "Keep") or reverts to internal (user chose "Switch").
- `isCustomStorageEnabled()` keeps reading `steam_storage_pref` so any GameHub-native Steam-side path resolution that uses it (`getAvailableStorage`, `getEffectiveStoragePath`) is unaffected.

#### Tradeoff (accepted by user)
The visible toggle is now BannerHub-only. There is no separate Steam SD-card toggle exposed in the UI, so users who want to put Steam on SD via this app cannot do so going forward (Steam stays internal or stays wherever it already is).

#### Why (Epic CDN ranking)
Epic's manifest API returns multiple CDN base URLs (Akamai, Fastly, Highwinds, etc.). The order isn't always optimized for the user's geo; the first-listed CDN can be much slower than alternates. Java port of upstream GameNative commit `e78d402`.

#### What changed (Epic CDN ranking)
- New `extension/CdnRankingUtils.java` (~155 LOC). Two entry points:
  - `rankBaseUrlsByHeadProbe(List<String>, userAgent)` — generic, returns reordered list. Future-proof for GOG (currently single-CDN in BH) or other stores.
  - `rankEpicCdnUrls(List<EpicDownloadManager.CdnUrl>, userAgent)` — Epic-specific, preserves CdnUrl identity (each entry carries its own cloudDir + authParams alongside baseUrl).
- Probe sends a HEAD request with 4s connect/read timeout per URL. Probes run in parallel via a fixed thread pool sized to `min(urls.size(), 8)`. Successful probes (HTTP 2xx-4xx) are preferred; ties broken by elapsed time. Failed/timeout probes go to the bottom.
- `EpicDownloadManager.Companion.parseManifestApiJson` now ranks CDNs once before downloading the manifest binary.
- `EpicDownloadManager.install` now ranks CDNs once before chunk downloads start. Adds a debug log line documenting the post-ranking order.
- Cloudflare-skip filter (`cloudflare.epicgamescdn.com`) preserved — those URLs are still excluded before ranking.

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre11 — feat(ui): storage location badge on install path row (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `f1b1696`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre11  |  **CI:** run 25023554124 ✅
#### What changed
- GOG, Epic, Amazon detail pages now show a colored pill badge next to the install path
- `💾 SD Card` (green on dark green) when path starts with the stored SD card root (`steam_storage_path` pref)
- `📱 Internal` (grey on dark grey) when path is in internal app storage
- Path + badge share a horizontal `LinearLayout` row; badge re-evaluates on every `refreshActionState()` call
- New fields: `storageTypeBadgeTV`, `installPathRow` (all three detail activities)
- New helper: `updateStorageBadge(String dir)` in each detail activity
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/AmazonGameDetailActivity.java`

---

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre10 — feat(settings): SD card storage toggle confirmation dialog + rename (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `3455663`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre10  |  **CI:** run 25023075869 ✅
#### What changed
- Turning the storage toggle ON now shows a dialog explaining games will save to `{SD card}/bannerhub/{store}/{game}/` and that install location is locked at install time
- Turning the toggle OFF shows a dialog explaining new games go to internal storage and existing SD card installs are not moved
- Both dialogs have Cancel (reverts switch visual) and Turn On/Turn Off (applies change) buttons
- Cancel path reverts the switch visually using `BhStorageToggleListener` (confirm=false → XOR newValue to restore old state)
- Confirm path calls `GameHubPrefs.handleSettingToggle(0x18, newValue)` — if SD card not found it still returns false and the switch resets
- Toggle label renamed from `"SD Card Storage"` → `"Save Store Games to External Storage (SD Card)"`
#### New files
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhStorageToggleListener.smali`
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes10/.../SettingSwitchHolder.smali` (intercept at `:cond_normal_toggle`)
- `patches/smali_classes6/.../GameHubPrefs.smali` (rename label string)

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre9 — feat(ui): uninstall progress spinner (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `1301cb7`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre9  |  **CI:** run 25022797024 ✅
#### What changed
- Shows a non-cancelable spinner dialog ("Uninstalling…") immediately after user confirms uninstall
- Dismisses just before the completion toast, covering the file deletion delay
- Applied to all uninstall paths across all three stores:
  - `GogGameDetailActivity`, `EpicGameDetailActivity`, `AmazonGameDetailActivity`
  - `GogGamesActivity` (game list context menu + `uninstall()` helper)
  - `BhDownloadsActivity` (download manager)
- New helper `showUninstallProgress()` added to each activity; returns non-cancelable `AlertDialog` with horizontal spinner + label
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/AmazonGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/BhDownloadsActivity.java`

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre8 — fix(gog): align detail page doUninstall with download manager (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `8865804`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre8  |  **CI:** run 25022366388 ✅
#### What changed
- `GogGameDetailActivity.doUninstall()` was calling `GogInstallPath.getInstallDir(this, dirName)` to reconstruct the path instead of using the stored absolute path directly
- Changed to `new File(dirName)` — same pattern as `BhDownloadsActivity` and `GogGamesActivity`
- Was accidentally working post-pre3 because Java ignores parent when child is absolute; fixed to be correct by design
- Epic and Amazon detail pages already used `new File(dir)` — no change needed
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogGameDetailActivity.java` (line 457)

---

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre7 — feat: install path display on game detail pages (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `cc219bf`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre7  |  **CI:** run 25019459591 ✅
#### What changed
- GOG, Epic, and Amazon game detail pages now show the full install path below the `.exe` row in the ACTIONS card
- Path is visible only when the game is installed; hidden otherwise
- Reads from `gog_dir_{gameId}`, `epic_dir_{appName}`, `amazon_dir_{productId}` prefs (already stores full absolute path since pre3)
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java`
- `extension/AmazonGameDetailActivity.java`

---

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre6 — fix(ui): hide system bars in Component Manager + Component Download (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `(pre6)`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre6  |  **CI:** run 25019028444 ✅
#### What changed
- Smali injection in `ComponentManagerActivity.onCreate`: bumped `.locals 0` → `.locals 3`, injected `WindowInsetsController.hide(statusBars|navBars)` + `setSystemBarsBehavior(BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE)`
- Added `onWindowFocusChanged` to `ComponentManagerActivity` (re-hides bars on focus return)
- Same injection in `ComponentDownloadActivity.onCreate` (already had `.locals 8`; added after `setContentView`)
- Added `onWindowFocusChanged` to `ComponentDownloadActivity`
- Key smali fix: `navigationBars()I` returns int — must use `move-result v2`, NOT `move-result-object`
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentDownloadActivity.smali`

**Commit:** `(pre5)`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre5  |  **CI:** run 25018854491 ✅
#### What changed
- Added `hideSystemBars()` + `onWindowFocusChanged` to `GogGameDetailActivity`, `EpicGameDetailActivity`, `AmazonGameDetailActivity`, `BhDownloadsActivity`

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre4 — fix(ui): hide status and nav bars in GOG/Epic/Amazon store screens (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `(pre4)`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre4  |  **CI:** run 25018293987 ✅
#### What changed
- Status bar and navigation bar were overlapping buttons at the top of all three store list screens
- Added `hideSystemBars()` using `WindowInsetsController` (API 30+) with legacy `setSystemUiVisibility` fallback
- Added `onWindowFocusChanged` override to re-apply on focus return
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java`

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre3 — fix: GOG uninstall now deletes from SD card correctly (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `1ff9b4c`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre3  |  **CI:** run 25015554884 ✅
#### What changed
- `GogDownloadManager` now saves the full absolute install path to `gog_dir_` pref (e.g. `/storage/XXXX/bannerhub/gog_games/Gun Slugs 2`) instead of just the folder name (`"Gun Slugs 2"`)
- `GogGamesActivity` uninstall now reads that absolute path directly and deletes it — no path reconstruction via `BhStoragePath` needed
- Fixes GOG games not being deleted on uninstall when installed to SD card
- Same pattern Amazon and Epic already used successfully
- `BhDownloadsActivity` GOG uninstall already used `new File(dir)` so it works automatically with the new full path
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogDownloadManager.java`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java`

---

### [pre-release] — v3.4.2-pre2 — feat: SD card storage toggle routes GOG/Epic/Amazon downloads to SD card (2026-04-27)
**Commit:** `a91f0b0`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre2  |  **CI:** run 25003766750 ✅
#### What changed
- Rewrote the SD Card Storage toggle behaviour — when enabled, GOG, Epic, and Amazon downloads now install to the SD card instead of internal storage
- New helper `BhStoragePath.java`: reads `use_custom_storage` + `steam_storage_path` prefs (set by the existing toggle detection logic) and returns `{sdCardRoot}/bannerhub/{storeFolder}/{gameName}` when on, `{filesDir}/{storeFolder}/{gameName}` when off
- `GogInstallPath.getInstallDir()` now delegates to `BhStoragePath` — all 4 GOG call sites in `GogGamesActivity` get SD card routing automatically
- `EpicGamesActivity`: install dir and StatFs storage check updated
- `AmazonGamesActivity`: install dir and StatFs storage check updated
- "Available storage" dialog in all three stores now reflects SD card free space when toggle is on
- SD card layout: `/storage/XXXX-XXXX/bannerhub/gog_games/`, `/storage/XXXX-XXXX/bannerhub/epic_games/`, `/storage/XXXX-XXXX/bannerhub/Amazon/`
- Toggle off behaviour unchanged — falls back to internal `getFilesDir()` as before
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhStoragePath.java` (new)
- `extension/GogInstallPath.java`
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java`
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md`

### [fix] — v3.4.2-pre1 — GOG: skip non-critical metadata files on CDN failure (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `58587f5`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre1  |  **CI:** run 24942760582 ✅
#### What changed
- Added `isNonCriticalGogFile()` helper in `GogDownloadManager.java`: matches `goggame-*.hashdb/.info/.ico/.script`
- On 3-retry CDN failure, matching files now log a warning and are skipped rather than setting `anyFailed` and aborting the entire install
- Fixes No Man's Sky (and any game with a bundled secondary product ID) where GOG metadata files for the secondary product ID fail because the `secure_link` CDN token is scoped to the primary product only
- Game content and exe are unaffected; these files are GOG Galaxy client metadata, not required for launch

---

### [rollback] — v3.4.2-pre1 + pre2 rolled back to v3.4.1 (2026-04-25)
**Action:** Deleted remote tags `v3.4.2-pre1` and `v3.4.2-pre2`; force-reset `main` to `v3.4.1` SHA `9048216`
#### What happened
- NeoStation `fromSteamLib` fix (pre1 + pre2) was reverted — the work was dropped, not parked
- Repo and main branch are clean at v3.4.1; no pre-release artifacts remain
#### If re-implementing later
- pre1: `startsWith("local_")` guard in `GameDetailActivity.smali` to block `fromSteamLib=true` for local import UUIDs
- pre2: additional `startsWith("{")` guard for unresolved NeoStation template tags (e.g. `{tags.steamappid}`)

---

### [fix] — v3.4.2-pre2 — Block fromSteamLib for unresolved NeoStation templates (2026-04-25) ⚠️ ROLLED BACK
**Commit:** `099ec34`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre2 (deleted)  |  **CI:** run 24941693436 ✅
#### What changed
- Extended pre1 fix: added `startsWith("{")` check alongside `startsWith("local_")` to block `fromSteamLib=true` when NeoStation sends a literal unresolved template tag (e.g. `{tags.steamappid}`) as the steamAppId
#### Files touched
- `GameDetailActivity.smali` (via CI patch in `build-quick.yml`)

---

### [fix] — v3.4.2-pre1 — Skip fromSteamLib=true for local_ import IDs from NeoStation (2026-04-25) ⚠️ ROLLED BACK
**Commit:** `b23a28b`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.2-pre1 (deleted)  |  **CI:** run 24941057062 ✅
#### What changed
- When NeoStation launches a local import game via `LAUNCH_GAME` intent, `steamAppId` receives a `local_` UUID which has `length > 0`, incorrectly setting `fromSteamLib=true` and crashing on the Steam library code path
- Added `startsWith("local_")` check after the length guard to route local imports correctly
#### Files touched
- `GameDetailActivity.smali` (via CI patch in `build-quick.yml`)

---

### [stable] — v3.4.1 — Hotfix: Frontend Export missing from stable build (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `9048216`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.1  |  **CI:** run 24938018763 ✅
#### What changed
- Cut stable from v3.4.1-pre1; no new code beyond the pre-release fix
- Latest stable; main currently points here after v3.4.2 rollback

---

### [fix] — v3.4.1-pre1 — Add Frontend Export to stable build.yml smali patch (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `d729899`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.1-pre1  |  **CI:** run 24937880585 ✅
#### What changed
- `build-quick.yml` already had the `GameDetailSettingMenu` smali injection for Frontend Export; `build.yml` was missing it entirely
- v3.4.0 stable shipped without the Frontend Export menu item; pre-releases worked fine
- Added the matching injection block to `build.yml` to fix stable builds
#### Files touched

### [docs] — README: Obtainium auto-update section (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `6fbe20e`  |  **Tag:** none  |  **CI:** n/a (docs only)
#### What changed
- Added `## Keeping BannerHub Updated` section after Installation, covering Obtainium setup
- Key point documented: "Reconcile version string with version detected from OS" must be ON; works correctly starting v3.4.0
- Warning callout added: do not track pre-releases in Obtainium (different package name)
- TOC updated with new section link
#### Files touched
- `README.md`

### [stable] — v3.4.0 — ES-DE frontend export, dynamic versioning (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `8e5ac3d`  |  **Tag:** v3.4.0  |  **CI:** run 24935382300 ✅
#### What changed
- Cut stable from v3.3.1-pre4; no new code beyond the pre-release series
- Release description: added Obtainium section (screenshot, "Reconcile version string with version detected from OS" toggle); Installation section now links to README#installation instead of inlining APK details
#### Files touched
- n/a (tag-only cut)

### [fix] — v3.3.1-pre3 — Restore Beacon/ES-DE items in frontend export dialog (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `dd90994`  |  **Tag:** v3.3.1-pre3  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- `setMessage()` and `setItems()` are mutually exclusive in `AlertDialog.Builder` — when both are called, `setItems()` silently drops the items
- Switched from `setMessage()` to `setCustomTitle()` using a `LinearLayout` containing title `TextView` + description `TextView`; items now render correctly alongside the description
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`

### [stable] — v3.3.0 — Background download service, download manager, ES-DE export, expanded config detail (2026-04-25)
**Commit:** `c284ef2`  |  **Tag:** v3.3.0  |  **CI:** run 24918245723 ✅
#### What changed
- Cut stable from v3.2.1-pre9; bundles all download service + manager work and the expanded config detail screen from v3.1.1-pre1
- Full set of new features: BhDownloadService foreground service, BhDownloadsActivity cross-store download manager, live ⬇ badge on dashboard, persistent game library, ES-DE frontend export, expanded config detail (11 rows), Beacon orphan task fix
#### Files touched
- n/a (tag-only cut)

### [fix] — v3.2.1-pre9 — Resolve classes11 DEX method ref overflow (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `2c0bfda`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre9  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- pre8 pushed the classes11 DEX over the 64K method reference limit causing a build-time overflow
- Moved excess methods to a less-loaded DEX bucket to bring classes11 back under the limit
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` / `build-quick.yml` (DEX split config)

---

### [feat] — v3.2.1-pre8 — Live download manager shortcut on dashboard (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `845617d`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre8  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- Replaced the BCI quick-launch button on the BannerHub dashboard with a direct shortcut to `BhDownloadsActivity`
- Button shows a live red count badge (e.g. **⬇ 2**) when downloads are active, updated in real time as jobs start and finish; returns to plain **⬇** when idle
- Badge driven by a `BroadcastReceiver` listening for `BhDownloadService` progress events — no polling
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhDashboardFragment.java`

---

### [fix] — v3.2.1-pre7 — Uninstall button after cancel/error; refresh game list on exit (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `8d0e29e`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre7  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- Cancelling or erroring a download now correctly shows the **Uninstall** button on the detail screen so partial game folders can be cleaned up without reopening the screen
- Uninstalling a game inside the download manager now immediately refreshes the game list on return — no more stale installed state after removal
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhDownloadsActivity.java`
- `extension/BhDownloadService.java`

---


### [feat] — v3.3.1-pre4 — Dynamic versionName + BH_VERSION from tag; phone-home hardcoded to 5.3.5 (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `d37fcf4b7`  |  **Tag:** v3.3.1-pre4  |  **CI:** ⏳ (triggered)
#### What changed
- CI now strips the `v` prefix from the git tag and injects the result as `versionName` in `apktool.yml` and `BH_VERSION` in `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java` — no more manual bumping of either value on any release
- `ClientParams.smali` (smali_classes13) and `TokenInterceptor.smali` (smali_classes7): `AppUtils->e()` (getAppVersionName) calls replaced with `const-string "5.3.5"` via CI Python patch so GameHub always phones home as 5.3.5 regardless of what Android displays
- Android now displays the BH version (e.g. `3.3.1-pre4`); game setting profiles embed the same version automatically
- **Critical note:** phone-home must stay at 5.3.5 (≥4.1.5). Reporting below 4.0 or between 4.0–4.1.5 causes the GameHub server to hide the Steam card on the dashboard
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`

### [feat] — v3.3.1-pre2 — Frontend Export dialog description (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `028a04534`  |  **Tag:** v3.3.1-pre2  |  **CI:** ⏳ (triggered)
#### What changed
- Frontend Export dialog now shows a description above the frontend list: "Select a frontend. The output file will be saved to:" followed by the resolved base path (`Downloads/bannerhub/frontend/`)
- Path is resolved at runtime via `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory`
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`

> **Release description note (v3.4.0 stable):** In the ES-DE section of the release description, include [RobZombie9043/steam-files-es-de](https://github.com/RobZombie9043/steam-files-es-de) as a user-facing fallback resource — pre-made `.steam` files for Steam catalog games in case the exported file doesn't work for a specific title.

### [feat] — v3.3.1-pre1 — ES-DE frontend export (.steam file) (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `02cc5984b`  |  **Tag:** v3.3.1-pre1  |  **CI:** ⏳ (triggered)
#### What changed
- Frontend Export dialog now lists two options: **Beacon** and **ES-DE**
- ES-DE export writes the resolved gameId to `Downloads/bannerhub/frontend/ES-DE/{gameName}.steam`
- Same gameId logic as Beacon: `localGameId` for imported games, `getSteamAppId()` for Steam catalog games
- No smali changes required — gameId resolution already handled in `BhFrontendExportLambda.smali`
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`
- `README.md`

### [fix] — v3.2.1-pre6 — Correct store pref keys for Launch from download manager (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `ddda57c3b`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre6  |  **CI:** ⏳ (triggered)
#### What changed
- GOG Launch from download manager was calling `GogLaunchHelper.triggerLaunch(this, exe)` which internally calls `activity.finish()` — closing BhDownloadsActivity instead of launching the game
- Amazon Launch was writing `pending_epic_exe` (wrong key) to `bh_amazon_prefs` instead of `pending_amazon_exe` — launcher would never pick it up
- Fix: `pendingLaunchExe` now takes an explicit pref-key parameter; each store passes its correct key (`pending_gog_exe` / `pending_epic_exe` / `pending_amazon_exe`); `GogLaunchHelper` no longer called from BhDownloadsActivity
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhDownloadsActivity.java`

---

### [feat] — v3.2.1-pre5 — Persistent game library in download manager (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `72b1f4f32`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre5  |  **CI:** run 24916480827 ⏳
#### What changed
- `BhDownloadsActivity` now doubles as a cross-store installed-game library
- Completed downloads persist to `bh_library` SharedPreferences in `BhDownloadService.saveLibraryEntry()`; survive app restart and navigation
- Completed rows: game name, store badge (Epic blue / GOG purple / Amazon orange), **Launch**, **Uninstall**, and **×** remove button
- Active download rows convert in-place to completed rows when the download finishes (no flicker)
- Library populated on `onResume` so rows are always present when returning to the screen
- **"Clear ✓"** header button removes all completed entries from view and prefs
- Launch: Epic/Amazon write `pending_epic_exe` to store-specific prefs + start main launcher; GOG uses `GogLaunchHelper.triggerLaunch`
- Uninstall: deletes install dir, clears `exe_` and `dir_` prefs, removes library entry
- `BhDownloadService.runGog` now stores `gog_dir_` pref and passes installDir (not exe path) to `notifyComplete` — consistent with Epic/Amazon
- Empty state text updated to "No downloads or installed games"
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhDownloadsActivity.java`
- `extension/BhDownloadService.java`

### [fix] — v3.2.1-pre4 — List-page downloads now route through BhDownloadService (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `54c0c957e`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre4  |  **CI:** run 24916138606 ⏳
#### What changed
- Downloads started from the game list screens (Epic, GOG, Amazon) now go through `BhDownloadService`, just like downloads from the detail page
- Added `startViaServiceAmazon`, `startViaServiceEpic`, `startViaServiceGog` helper methods that fire `startForegroundService` + register a `DownloadListener` bridge to the card UI callbacks
- All 7 inline download call sites in the three list activities replaced: `startAmazonDownload` × 2, `startEpicDownload` × 2, `GogDownloadManager.startDownload` × 3
- GOG grid dialog `onComplete` updated: exe path now looked up from prefs (`gog_exe_` + gameId) rather than using the install-dir string passed from the service
- Card UI progress still updates live via listener; notification bar and BhDownloadsActivity now show list-page downloads
#### Files touched
- `extension/AmazonGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/EpicGamesActivity.java`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java`

### [fix] — v3.2.1-pre3 — Foreground service types + runtime notification permission (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `caf55a49e`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre3  |  **CI:** run 24915638870 ⏳
#### What changed
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: added `android:foregroundServiceType="specialUse"` to all 12 GameHub services missing a type — fixes `MissingForegroundServiceTypeException` crash on launch (Android 14+ with targetSdk 35)
  - `DeviceManagementService`, `DownloadService`, `MappingService`, `KeyboardEditService`, `SSLClientService`, `VTouchIPCService`, `UnzipService`, `EmuFileService`, `SteamService`, `DiscoveryService`, `ComputerManagerService`, `UsbDriverService`
- `EpicGameDetailActivity`, `GogGameDetailActivity`, `AmazonGameDetailActivity`: added `requestPermissions(POST_NOTIFICATIONS)` check at top of `startInstall()` (API 33+ guard); user is prompted for notification permission the first time they start a download
#### Files touched
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java`

### [feat] — v3.2.1-pre2 — In-app download manager screen (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `ecae59d15`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre2  |  **CI:** run 24915238124 ⏳
#### What changed
- `BhDownloadsActivity`: new screen showing all active downloads with live progress bars and per-download Cancel button; shows "No active downloads" when idle
- `BhDownloadService`: added `GlobalListener` interface for watching all downloads at once; `getActiveJobs()`, `getGameName()`, `getLastMsg()`, `getLastPct()` for activity reconnect on resume; last-progress snapshot maps
- `GogGamesActivity`, `EpicGamesActivity`, `AmazonGamesActivity`: ⬇ button added to header, launches `BhDownloadsActivity`
- Error rows stay visible for 3 seconds before auto-removing
#### Files touched

### [feat] — v3.2.1-pre1 — Background download service (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `b9437a29c`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.1-pre1  |  **CI:** run 24914826132 ⏳
#### What changed
- New `BhDownloadService` (foreground service): downloads for Epic, GOG, and Amazon now run in the background — user can leave the game detail screen while downloading
- Persistent progress notification shows game name, progress bar, and a Cancel action
- Activity reconnects live progress on resume if the service is still running (`BhDownloadService.isActive()` + `addListener()`)
- When the activity is not visible, completion/error posts a notification instead
- Service auto-picks the best exe on completion (same scoring as before); "Set .exe…" button still available if the user wants to change it
- Back-press on detail activities no longer cancels a download — user must cancel via notification or the Cancel button
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: added `BhDownloadService` declaration with `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`, plus `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhDownloadService.java` (new)
- `extension/EpicGameDetailActivity.java`

### [stable] — v3.2.0 — Expanded config detail, Frontend Export, Beacon fixes (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `9b547e687`  |  **Tag:** v3.2.0  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- BH_VERSION bumped to 3.2.0
- Includes: expanded config detail screen (pre1), Beacon orphan task fix (pre6), Frontend Export feature (pre7/8/9)
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java` (BH_VERSION → 3.2.0)

### [fix] — v3.1.1-pre9 — Frontend Export: correct Steam App ID for catalog games (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `3001c6ab5`  |  **Tag:** v3.1.1-pre9  |  **CI:** run 24905687673 ✅
#### What changed
- `BhFrontendExportLambda.smali`: replaced `getId()` with `getSteamAppId()` for catalog game ID resolution
- Root cause: `getId()` returns BannerHub's internal server catalog ID, not the Steam App ID; catalog games were writing the wrong number to the `.iso` file
- ID resolution order: `getLocalGameId()` (non-null/non-empty) → imported game UUID; else `getSteamAppId()` → actual Steam App ID string
- Confirmed working: catalog games now write correct Steam App ID; imported games continue to write their localGameId
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/gamedetail/BhFrontendExportLambda.smali`

---

### [feat] — v3.1.1-pre7/pre8 — Frontend Export feature (2026-04-24)
**Commits:** pre7 initial + pre8 localGameId priority fix  |  **Tags:** v3.1.1-pre7, v3.1.1-pre8  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- New "Frontend Export" option in PC game settings popup (alongside Import/Export Config)
- Tapping shows a list of frontends; selecting Beacon writes `Downloads/bannerhub/frontend/Beacon/{gameName}.iso` containing the game's ID
- `BhFrontendExportLambda.smali`: new synthetic lambda class wired into `GameDetailSettingMenu.W()` via smali injection
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`: added `showFrontendExportDialog()` and `exportForBeacon()` methods
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`: added third Option block in the settings menu injection
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/gamedetail/BhFrontendExportLambda.smali` (new)
- `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`

### [fix] — v3.1.1-pre6 — Beacon launch no longer shows 2nd BannerHub in recents (2026-04-24)
**Commits:** `a9f2989` (pre5, finishAndRemoveTask attempt) + `fb2eab3` (pre6, manifest fix)  |  **Tag:** v3.1.1-pre6  |  **CI:** run 24902240605 ✅
#### What changed
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`: added `android:excludeFromRecents="true"` to `GameDetailActivity`
- Root cause: Beacon launches `GameDetailActivity` with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` + `taskAffinity=""`, which always creates an isolated orphan task; that task was appearing as a second BannerHub instance in recents
- Fix: since `GameDetailActivity` is always the root of that isolated task, `excludeFromRecents=true` tells Android to never register it in the recents list
- Verified in logcat: task 7240 (GameDetailActivity) is never brought `moveTaskToFront` from recents; only task 7241 (WineActivity) appears
- Note: smali `finishAndRemoveTask()` patch (pre4/pre5) was confirmed non-functional — the `t3()` code path is not reached during Beacon auto-launch; left in place but has no effect
#### Files touched
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml`

### [feat] — v3.1.1-pre1 — Expanded config detail screen (2026-04-24)
**Commit:** `c48dbb1` + reverts `7ba24bb` `1e96f09`  |  **Tag:** v3.1.1-pre1 (retagged)  |  **CI:** run 24895871530 ⏳
**Note:** Tag recreated after reverting v3.1.1-pre and v3.1.1-pre2 fix commits — pre1 is now purely the config detail feature on top of v3.1.0.
#### What changed
- `BhGameConfigsActivity.fetchMeta()`: expanded meta card from 4 rows to up to 11
- Now shows: Wine / Proton, DXVK, VKD3D, GPU Driver, FEXCore, Box64, Resolution, Command Line, Env Vars — in addition to existing Renderer, CPU, FPS Cap, BH Version, Settings count, Components count
- Added `parseSettingName()` helper — parses nested JSON strings in settings values, prefers `name` field with fallback to `displayName`
- Resolution key has a game-id suffix so it's found via prefix scan (`pc_s_resolution_w*`)
- All new rows are conditional — only shown if the field is present and non-empty in the config
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhGameConfigsActivity.java`

### [docs] — GameHub 6.0 migration prep docs (2026-04-23)
**Commit:** `1689aa7`  |  **Tag:** none
**CI:** n/a (docs only, no build)
#### What changed
- Added 5 reference documents to prepare for eventual GameHub 6.0 (KMP) rebase
- `migration/INJECTION_MAP.md` — maps all 150+ smali injection points by feature area
- `migration/FEATURE_SPECS.md` — behavioral specs for all 56 BannerHub features; implementation-independent
- `migration/GAMEHUB_6_ARCHITECTURE.md` — KMP/Compose Multiplatform smali patching guide; GameHub 6.0 not yet public as of 2026-04-23; biggest risk on release = R8 obfuscation
- `migration/STANDALONE_FEASIBILITY.md` — feasibility analysis for extracting Component Manager and HUD Overlay as standalone apps (both feasible, ~2-3 weeks each)
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_CONTRACT.md` — full API contract for community config Cloudflare Worker (11 endpoints, 7 version-specific risks flagged)
#### Files touched
- CLOUDFLARE_API_CONTRACT.md (new)

### [pre] — v3.1.1-pre — Epic chunk silent truncation fix (2026-04-16)
**Commit:** `2a02996f4`  |  **Tag:** v3.1.1-pre
**CI:** pending
#### What changed
- Fix: Epic downloads could silently write partial chunk files when HTTP connection dropped mid-stream. The `n<=0` break in `downloadChunkStreaming` exited without error, chunk was counted as OK, then assembly crashed with `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=<partial>; regionLength=1048576`. Now tracks `writtenBytes` during inflation and validates against `chunk.windowSize`; mismatch deletes partial file and retries next CDN.
#### Files touched
- extension/EpicDownloadManager.java (downloadChunkStreaming)

### [stable] — v3.1.0 — Full-screen detail pages, update checkers, DLC, cloud saves (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `d29f5fb4c`  |  **Tag:** v3.1.0
**CI:** ✅ run 24422975293
#### What changed
- Full-screen game detail activities (GOG, Epic, Amazon) — cover art, description, install size, release date, GOG ratings
- GOG/Epic/Amazon update checkers — Check for Updates / Update Now buttons
- DLC management for all 3 stores — list, install, uninstall individual DLCs
- GOG Cloud Saves — upload/download, game-scoped token (clientSecret exchange), folder picker
- Epic Cloud Saves — upload/download via datastorage API
- FolderPickerActivity — root dropdown + New Folder button
- Epic free games redesign — dedicated FreeGamesActivity
#### Files touched
- extension/BhSettingsExporter.java (BH_VERSION → 3.1.0)

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — GOG cloud saves: friendly error for unsupported games (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `24a287b6f`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** run 24413240848 (queued)
#### What changed
- Debug log confirmed: scoped token works (HTTP 200) but GOG returns HTTP 400 `not_enabled_for_client` — cloud saves disabled for this game's clientId
- `getRequest()`: detects `not_enabled_for_client` / `disabled` in error body → throws sentinel `CLOUD_SAVES_NOT_SUPPORTED`
- Upload/download catch: shows "This game does not support GOG cloud saves" instead of raw HTTP 400 body

---

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — getOrFetchClientId: don't skip fetch if clientSecret missing (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `46aa765c7`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** run 24412836097 (queued)
#### What changed
- `getOrFetchClientId()` was returning early if `clientId` was in prefs, even if `clientSecret` was not. For games downloaded before clientSecret caching was added, this meant the manifest was never re-fetched and `getGameScopedToken()` always fell back to the Galaxy token (→ 403). Now only skips the fetch if both clientId AND clientSecret are cached.

---

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — GOG cloud saves: game-scoped token via clientSecret exchange (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `69b05efff`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** run 24412652305 (queued)
#### What changed
- Root cause confirmed from debug log: GOG cloudstorage API requires a game-scoped token, not the Galaxy app token. Token must be obtained by re-using Galaxy `refresh_token` but with the game's `clientId`+`clientSecret` from the build manifest.
- `GogDownloadManager.runGen2()`: extract + cache `clientSecret` as `gog_client_secret_{gameId}`
- `GogDownloadManager.getOrFetchClientId()`: also caches `clientSecret` as side effect
- `GogCloudSaveManager.getGameScopedToken()`: new — reads clientId+clientSecret+Galaxy refresh_token, exchanges at auth.gog.com for scoped token. Falls back to Galaxy token if clientSecret missing.
- Exception messages now written to debug file; log shows `scopedToken=ok` vs `fallback`

---

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — Debug file path → /sdcard/ for Termux access (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `14db4654f`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** run 24412339253 (queued)
#### What changed
- Changed debug file from `getExternalFilesDir()` (scoped, inaccessible from Termux) to `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()` (`/sdcard/bh_cloud_debug.txt`), readable with `cat /sdcard/bh_cloud_debug.txt` directly from Termux.

---

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — Cloud save debug logging + GOG clientId on-demand fetch (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `09112bc57`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** ✅ run 24411920035
#### What changed
- **GOG clientId on-demand fetch:** `GogDownloadManager.getOrFetchClientId()` — checks prefs; if `gog_client_id_{gameId}` is missing (game installed before caching was added), fetches content-system.gog.com builds endpoint, downloads + decompresses the Gen2 manifest, extracts clientId, caches it. Falls back to gameId only if the manifest fetch fails entirely.
- **GogCloudSaveManager:** both `uploadSaves()` and `downloadSaves()` now use `getOrFetchClientId()` instead of direct prefs lookup.
- **Debug file:** both GOG and Epic cloud save managers now write to `bh_cloud_debug.txt` in `getExternalFilesDir`. Logs: gameId/userId/clientId (GOG) or appName/accountId (Epic), exact cloudstorage/datastorage URL, HTTP code, body snippet or error body.

---

### [fix] — v3.0.4-pre — Cloud save 403 fixes (GOG clientId + Epic token refresh) (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `4c7b8777c`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre (retagged)
**CI:** ✅ run 24411113083
#### What changed
- **GOG**: `GogDownloadManager.runGen2()` now extracts `clientId` from manifest JSON header and caches as `gog_client_id_{gameId}` in bh_gog_prefs. `GogCloudSaveManager` reads this cached clientId (falls back to gameId). Root cause: product ID ≠ Galaxy client ID — GOG cloudstorage URL requires the client ID.
- **Epic**: Removed broken `getValidToken()` from `EpicCloudSaveManager` which read `"expires_at"` but wrote back `"epic_expires_at"` (wrong key), causing stale tokens. Now uses `EpicCredentialStore.getValidAccessToken(ctx)` which handles refresh correctly.
#### Files touched
- extension/GogDownloadManager.java (extract + cache manifestClientId in runGen2)
- extension/GogCloudSaveManager.java (use gog_client_id_{gameId} from prefs)
- extension/EpicCloudSaveManager.java (replace getValidToken with EpicCredentialStore.getValidAccessToken)

### [feat] — v3.0.1-pre — D-5 release dates + GOG-2/EPIC-3/AMAZON-1 update checkers (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `d9d595f37`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.1-pre (retagged)
**CI:** ✅ run 24401674991
#### What changed
- D-5 (Release date in GAME INFO): GOG syncs `release_date` from product JSON as `gog_release_{id}`; Epic syncs `viewableDate`/`effectiveDate` from catalog enrichment as `epic_release_{appName}`; Both GOG+Epic detail pages show "Released: MMM D, YYYY" row in GAME INFO card. Amazon skipped (no API source).
- GOG-2 (Update Checker): `GogDownloadManager.runGen2()` now stores `gog_build_{gameId}` in bh_gog_prefs at install time. `GogGameDetailActivity` UPDATES section replaced with real card: shows installed build ID, "Check for Updates" button hits content-system.gog.com builds endpoint, compares build_id, shows "Up to date ✓" or "Update available!" + "Update Now" button.
- EPIC-3 (Update Checker): `EpicApiClient.getManifestApiJson()` now includes `versionId` from `elements[0]` in wrapper JSON. `EpicGameDetailActivity.startInstall()` stores `epic_manifest_version_{appName}` after successful install. UPDATES section replaced with real card: "Check for Updates" re-fetches manifest, compares versionId.
- AMAZON-1 (Update Checker): `AmazonDownloadManager.install()` stores `amazon_manifest_version_{productId}` from `spec.versionId` after install. `AmazonGameDetailActivity` UPDATES replaced with real card using `AmazonApiClient.getLiveVersionId()` for version check.
- All 3 update checkers: first-check baseline auto-sets if version was never stored; "Update Now" button re-runs the existing install pipeline.
#### Files touched

### [feat] — v3.0.1-pre — Install size on game detail pages (GOG/Epic/Amazon) (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `57b04441f`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.1-pre (retagged)
**CI:** triggered
#### What changed
- GOG: `GogDownloadManager.fetchInstallSizeBytes()` — fetches Gen2 builds + top-level manifest, sums `depot.size` for en/all depots. Called during library sync, cached as `gog_size_{gameId}`. Detail page shows size instantly from cache.
- Epic: `EpicDownloadManager.fetchInstallSizeBytes()` — fetches manifest API JSON + binary manifest, sums `chunk.windowSize`. Lazy on first detail page open, cached as `epic_size_{appName}`.
- Amazon: `AmazonDownloadManager.fetchInstallSizeBytes()` — fetches GetGameDownload spec + manifest.proto, reads `totalInstallSize`. Lazy on first detail page open, cached as `amazon_size_{productId}`.
- All 3 detail pages: "Install size: X.X GB" in GAME INFO card. Shows "Fetching…" while loading, instant on subsequent opens.
#### Files touched

### [fix] — v3.0.1-pre — Strip HTML from game descriptions in detail pages (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `0edb2f9ca`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.1-pre (retagged)
**CI:** triggered
#### What changed
- GOG API returns HTML-formatted descriptions (`<h4>`, `<br>`, `<strong>` etc.) — were rendering as raw tags
- GogGameDetailActivity: `Html.fromHtml(description, FROM_HTML_MODE_COMPACT)` on description TextView
- EpicGameDetailActivity: strip HTML via `fromHtml().toString()` before truncating (so truncation never cuts mid-tag); char limit raised 300→400 to compensate for stripped tag overhead

### [fix] — v2.9.3-pre — Export/import 0/0 for catalog games with getId() > 0 (2026-04-13)
**Commit:** `498548946`  |  **Tag:** v2.9.3-pre (retagged)
**CI:** triggered
#### What changed
- Previous fix (check `getLocalGameId().isEmpty()` → fall back to `getId()`) was backwards. Found GameHub's actual gameId resolution in `GameDetailActivity` lines 6363-6406: `if getId() > 0 → String.valueOf(getId())`, `else → getLocalGameId()`. Replicated this exact `if-gtz` branch in both `BhExportLambda` and `BhImportLambda`.
- Catalog games (GTA IV CE, GTA V Enhanced, REANIMAL, Titanfall 2) have `getId() > 0`; their SP is `"pc_g_setting271590"` etc. Local-only games (CS:S, L4D2, God of War, Planet of Lana 2) have `getId() == 0` so `getLocalGameId()` applies.

### [fix] — v2.9.3-pre — Export/import still 0/0 for catalog games (2026-04-13)
**Commit:** `e1ef76c6d`  |  **Tag:** v2.9.3-pre (retagged)
**CI:** triggered
#### What changed
- Previous fix (getLocalGameId()) worked for locally-added games but not GameHub catalog/server games. For catalog games `getLocalGameId()` returns `""` — per-game settings are stored in `"pc_g_setting" + getId()` (integer server game ID as string, e.g. `"pc_g_setting271590"`).
- Both `BhExportLambda` and `BhImportLambda`: if `getLocalGameId()` is empty, fall back to `String.valueOf(getId())` before passing to `BhSettingsExporter`.
- Verified from exported JSONs: GTA IV CE, GTA V Enhanced, REANIMAL, Titanfall 2 still had 0/0 (catalog games); Planet of Lana 2, CS:S, God of War, L4D2 working (20/3, 20/0, 18/0, 20/0).

### [fix] — v2.9.3-pre — Export/import config showed 0 settings and 0 components (2026-04-13)
**Commit:** `cf42c7619`  |  **Tag:** v2.9.3-pre (retagged)
**CI:** triggered
#### What changed
- Root cause: `BhExportLambda`/`BhImportLambda` called `GameDetailEntity.getId()` (int) instead of `getLocalGameId()` (String). For locally-added games, GameHub stores per-game settings in SP named `"pc_g_setting" + localGameId` where localGameId is a UUID string like `"local_5f129d63-..."`. Passing the int produced SP names like `"pc_g_setting0"` which are always empty.
- `BhSettingsExporter`: all `int gameId` parameters changed to `String gameId`; `if (gameId > 0)` guard → `if (gameId != null && !gameId.isEmpty())`
- `BhExportLambda.smali`: `getId()I` → `getLocalGameId()Ljava/lang/String;`; descriptor updated
- `BhImportLambda.smali`: same change for `showImportDialog`
- `BhGameConfigsActivity`: `List<Integer> gameIds` → `List<String> gameIds`; SP scanning now also collects `local_*` UUID suffixes (previously all skipped via `NumberFormatException`); local games shown as "Local Game (...XXXXXXXX)" in Apply to Game picker

### [fix] — v2.9.3-pre — GOG Akamai CDN chunk URL fix (2026-04-10)
**Commit:** `4f3c515b5`  |  **Tag:** v2.9.3-pre
**CI:** ✅ run 24243862420 (artifact only)
#### What changed
GOG downloads failed for games whose `secure_link` returned an Akamai CDN (`gog-cdn.akamaized.net`). The token-bearing `?__token__=...` query string was part of `cdnBase`, so appending the chunk hash produced an invalid URL with the path after the query string. Fix: insert chunk path before `?` if present. Same fix applied to BH-Lite (v0.4.1-pre, run 24243696154 ✅).
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogDownloadManager.java` — chunk URL construction

**Commit:** `2cae1cc21`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.9-pre6
**CI:** ✅ run 23984210142 (artifact only)
#### What changed
- Pass 1: query StarterGame by `gameId` (server games); Pass 2: query unmatched IDs by `id` (locally-added games — GameHub uses Room PK as SP key for these)
- Extracted `resolveGameName()` helper: null/empty gameName → last filePath segment → "Game #id"
- God of War (and similar locally-added games) now show real names
#### Files touched

**CI:** ✅ run 23982476410 (artifact only)
#### What changed
- Worker: KV write limit (1,000/day free tier) was exhausted → uncaught exception → CF 1101 crash; all `put`/`delete` calls now use `kvPut`/`kvDelete` helpers that catch quota errors silently; top-level try-catch added
- App: `fetchGames()` and `fetchConfigs()` now parse via `JSONTokener` and validate root is JSONArray before casting; error objects show proper Toast instead of crashing
- CF worker redeployed; confirmed working (89 games returned)
#### Files touched
- extension/BhGameConfigsActivity.java

### [pre] — v2.8.9-pre3 — Apply to Game picker: shared_prefs scan instead of full ux_db (2026-04-04)
**Commit:** `e0b5038ab`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.9-pre3
**CI:** ✅ run 23982010393 (artifact only; first attempt ❌ run 23981926309 — var name collision)
#### What changed
- Apply to Game picker now scans `shared_prefs/pc_g_setting*.xml` to find games that actually have configs
- Cross-references names from `ux_db` for only those IDs — games without a SP file are excluded
- Falls back to "Game #id" label if a SP file exists but no ux_db name entry
#### Files touched
- extension/BhGameConfigsActivity.java

### [pre] — v2.8.9-pre2 — Apply to Game from community config browser (2026-04-04)
**Commit:** `c4c20fb48`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.9-pre2
**CI:** ✅ run 23981547373 (artifact only)
#### What changed
- Config detail screen: "Apply to Game..." button replaces the old grey note
- Downloads config JSON, queries `ux_db` → `StarterGame` for all installed games (A–Z), shows picker dialog
- On selection: runs full `BhSettingsExporter.applyConfig()` logic (settings write + missing component download prompt)
- `BhSettingsExporter.applyConfig()` made package-private to allow cross-class access within same package
#### Files touched

**Commit:** `9abbf8031`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.9-pre1
**CI:** ✅ run 23981281809 (artifact only)
#### What changed
- `detectSoc()` helper reads `/sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/gpu_model` first (returns e.g. `Adreno33v2` on AYANEO Pocket FIT / OCed SD8G3)
- Falls back to `Build.SOC_MODEL` (API 31+, skips "unknown") then `Build.HARDWARE`
- Both `meta.soc` in JSON and the config filename now use this value

## [stable] — v2.8.8 — Community Game Configs browser (2026-04-04)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.8
**Commit:** `b2c789300`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23969711793 (9 APKs)
**What changed:**
- Stable release of the full Game Configs community browser feature
- Fix: `sc`/`cc` variables in `fetchMeta()` made effectively final (`finalSc`/`finalCc`) — was causing CI failure at line 933
- Fix: community import URL in `BhSettingsExporter.showCommunityImportDialog` — was using nonexistent `download_url` field; now constructs from `game_folder` + `filename`
- Fix: `fetchMeta` flat-format fallback correctly counts root-level keys (minus `meta`/`components`) for configs that predate the `settings` wrapper key
- Cloudflare Worker deployed (`bannerhub-configs-worker`): BootstrapPackagedGame system folder filtered from `/games`; download count tracking (`downloads:<sha>` KV, incremented on `/download`); `/describe` (POST, token-auth) and `/desc` (GET) endpoints; `/list` now returns `downloads` field per entry
- Release description written with warning block, new features, full feature set, installation guide

## [fix] — v2.8.7-pre1 — Export/Import Config crash fix (coroutine register bug) (2026-04-03)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.7-pre1 (retagged)
**Commit:** `ddbde2eb7`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23954703877
**What changed:**
- Root cause: W() (getPcGamesOptions) is a Kotlin coroutine. On resume, p1 is null —
  Kotlin doesn't re-pass the original params. Previous injection used `move-object v2, p0`
  which also overwrote v2 (the GameDetailEntity at that smali point, later clobbered by
  StringBuilder before our injection runs at the XjLog anchor).
- Fix: read entity via `iget-object v3, v5, ...->L$0:Ljava/lang/Object;` + `check-cast v3,
  GameDetailEntity` at injection point (v5 = continuation, L$0 = GameDetailEntity, stable
  across all code paths). Use `p0` (= this, always stable) in BhImportLambda ctor.
- Fixed in both build-quick.yml and build.yml.

## [feat] — v2.8.4-pre — Konkr HUD overlay (BhKonkrHud) (2026-04-02)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.4-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `876140872`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23917514999 (includes layout fixes)
**What changed:**
- New `BhKonkrHud.java`: Konkr-style HUD overlay reproducing the reference layout
  - Vertical (default): 2-column table — FPS (16sp large), CPU%+temp, per-core MHz
    (CPU0-7), GPU%+temp+name+freq+res, MODE/FAN/SKN/PWR, RAM (brown label bg),
    SWAP (gray label bg), BAT (blue proportional fill progress bar), TIME
  - Horizontal (tap to toggle): compact multi-column strip — FPS block
    (current/min FPS/cpuTemp), CPU 8-core 2×4 grid, GPU block, thermal/power
    2-column block, memory block with colored label backgrounds
  - New data sources: readGpuName() (/sys kgsl gpu_model), readFanSpeed()
    (cooling devices scan), readSkinTemp() (thermal zone scan),
    readRamGb()/readSwapGb() (GB used/total), readBatPct(), readPwr(),
    readMode() (MAX/SUST/NORM from bh_prefs)
  - BAT: blue fill proportional to battery % via LinearLayout weight update
  - FPS min tracking (reset every 60 samples)
  - Pref keys: konkr_hud_vertical, konkr_hud_pos_x/y — tag: bh_konkr_hud
- New `BhHudKonkrListener.smali`: OnCheckedChangeListener for Konkr checkbox;
  when checked clears hud_extra_detail + unchecks Extra Detail cb in UI
- `BhHudInjector.smali`: added 3rd HUD block; priority = konkr > detail > basic;
  BhFrameRating only when hud&&!extra&&!konkr; BhDetailedHud when hud&&extra&&!konkr
- `BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`: adds "Konkr Style" CheckBox below "Extra Detailed"
  with same enable/disable/alpha logic tied to winlator_hud state
- `BhHudExtraDetailListener.smali`: when checked clears hud_konkr_style and
  unchecks Konkr cb in UI (mutual exclusivity); 7 locals

## [fix] — v2.8.3-pre — HUD toggle not showing + Extra Detail guard + opacity rebuild (2026-04-02)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.3-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `b903a74c4`  |  **CI:** ✅
**What changed:**
- BhHudStyleSwitchListener: replaced manual BhFrameRating find/show with `injectOrUpdate(activity)` — fixes HUD not appearing when turned on (view never existed); also clears hud_extra_detail pref on HUD-off
- BhHudExtraDetailListener: guard bails if `winlator_hud=false`; delegates to `injectOrUpdate()` instead of manual swap
- BhDetailedHud.buildLayout(): re-applies `applyBackgroundOpacity()` after every rebuild so orientation-toggled TextViews get shadow rules

---

## [fix] — v2.8.3-pre — BhDetailedHud column alignment + opacity slider (2026-04-02)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.3-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `cbea54e68`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23883928447
**What changed:**
- buildHorizontal() rewritten as column groups — separators now form solid vertical dividers between rows
- BhHudOpacityListener also calls applyBackgroundOpacity on BhDetailedHud

## [feat] — v2.8.3-pre — Extra Detailed HUD overlay (2026-04-02)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.3-pre
**Commit:** `5ab0566be`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23882828021
**What changed:**
- New `BhDetailedHud.java` (classes18.dex): 2-row horizontal HUD + vertical tap-toggle
  - Horizontal: TIME/CPU%/CPU°C/cores C0-C7/BAT W/BAT°C (row1) + API/GPU%/GPU°C/RAM%/FPS graph (row2)
  - Vertical: all stats in one column including GPU MHz, SWAP used/total GB
  - Per-stat individual temperatures (CPU cluster, GPU kgsl, battery)
  - Drag to reposition, position persists (hud_detail_pos_x/y), shared hud_opacity
- `BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`: Extra Detail checkbox enabled only when HUD is ON; wires listener
- `BhHudInjector.smali`: manages both HUDs — shows correct one based on both prefs
- `BhHudStyleSwitchListener.smali`: HUD toggle off clears/disables Extra Detail, hides BhDetailedHud
- `BhHudExtraDetailListener.smali`: swaps BhFrameRating ↔ BhDetailedHud on checkbox change

## [stable] — v2.8.2 — Controller navigation, store UI polish, perf improvements (2026-04-02)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2
**Commit:** `6a2c8d160`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23879145996 (9 APKs)
**What changed since v2.8.1:**
- Controller focus highlight: gold border on all cards/tiles + header buttons (3 stores × 3 views)
- Grid/poster A-button: focusWrapper forwards click/longClick to tile
- Store UI polish: developer subtitle, empty state, sync color-coding, progress bar tint
- Epic install size fix: discard cached values > 1 TB
- 8 parallel threads, GOG retry+resume, Epic chunk streaming, 128KB buffers

## [fix] — v2.8.2-pre — Grid/poster focus highlight clipped by setClipToOutline (2026-04-01)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `70b981a24`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23877451621
**What changed:**
- Root cause: `tile.setClipToOutline(true)` clips the stroke to the outline boundary — stroke was invisible in all grid/poster views
- Fix: each tile now wrapped in a transparent `focusWrapper` FrameLayout (no `clipToOutline`) that carries the gold border; inner tile keeps `clipToOutline` for art corner clipping
- Applies to all 3 stores × grid + poster view modes

---

## [feat] — v2.8.2-pre5 — Controller focus highlight: gold border + bg tint on GOG/Epic/Amazon cards (2026-04-01)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2-pre5 (retagged)
**Commit:** `84e4c4920`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- Root cause fix: FOCUS_BLOCK_DESCENDANTS on all 6 card/tile roots (3 stores × list + grid/poster) — child buttons were stealing D-pad focus so onFocusChangeListener never fired on card root
- Focused state: 3dp gold (#FFD700) stroke + slightly lighter background tint
- Unfocused state: no stroke, original background color

- Epic: `bh_epic_debug.txt` — CDN URLs, manifest bytes, chunk failures, assembly errors, result
- Amazon: `bh_amazon_debug.txt` — entitlementId, downloadUrl, manifest size, per-file failures, result
- GOG Gen1/Gen2: parallel retry/fail logged via ConcurrentLinkedQueue → drained into `bh_gog_debug.txt`

## [fix] — epic-integration — uninstall hides both checkmarks immediately (2026-03-29)
**Branch:** `epic-integration`  |  **Commit:** `026d9d2ec`
**CI:** run 23721449352 (in progress)
**What changed:** When uninstall completes in Amazon, GOG, or Epic, both the collapsed header ✓ (collapsedCheckTV) and expanded section checkmark disappear immediately via `onUninstalled` Runnable callback.

## [feat] — v2.7.5-pre25 — black text outline below 30% opacity (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre25
**Commit:** `e788691bb`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:** applyBackgroundOpacity() calls setShadowLayer(3f,0,0,black) on all TextViews when opacity<30, clears otherwise. BhHudOpacityListener simplified to delegate to this method.

## [fix] — v2.7.5-pre19 — translationY replaces topMargin, eliminates height constraint (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre19
**Commit:** `45c267b03`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- Root fix for vertical+detailed clipping: topMargin stays 0; vertical position uses setTranslationY(). FrameLayout always measures with AT_MOST screenH. Drag and reclampPosition both updated to use translationY.

**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre13
**Commit:** `cf275a55d`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- `reclampPosition()` now synchronous: measures unconstrained immediately after orientation/visibility changes, fixes topMargin before FrameLayout layout pass runs — no more clip flash
- Pref-change path uses `handler.post` (one frame) then synchronous reclamp
- Removed `postDelayed(32ms)`
#### Files touched

## [fix] — v2.7.5-pre12 — reclampPosition unconstrained height measure (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre12
**Commit:** `62a577644`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- `reclampPosition()` calls `measure(AT_MOST screenW, UNSPECIFIED)` to get natural height before clamping `topMargin` — fixes overlay clipping below CPU cores when positioned low on screen in vertical+extra-detail mode
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`

## [fix] — v2.7.5-pre11 — tall-narrow vertical: WRAP_CONTENT, 2-per-row cores, trimmed labels (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre11
**Commit:** `02a31c689`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- Removed 220dp fixed width; WRAP_CONTENT in both modes — vertical overlay width driven by content
- CPU cores: 4+4 → 2+2+2+2 (C0/C1, C2/C3, C4/C5, C6/C7)
- GPU info: model and MHz split to two lines; "GPU TMP" → "TMP"; SWAP → "SW --/--G"; RAM format tightened

## [fix] — v2.7.5-pre10 — font sizes, fixed vertical width, postDelayed reclamp (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre10
**Commit:** `656ca8a4b`  |  **CI:** queued
**What changed:**
- Main stat labels: 11sp → 10sp; extra detail labels: 10sp → 9sp
- `toggleOrientation()` sets FrameLayout.LayoutParams.width = 220dp in vertical mode (WRAP_CONTENT in horizontal) — fixes extra detail rows being narrow/clipped when overlay is on left side of screen
- `reclampPosition()` switched from OnGlobalLayoutListener to `postDelayed(32ms)` — ensures `getHeight()` reflects the fully settled vertical layout before clamping
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`

## [fix] — v2.7.5-pre9 — overlay clamp after toggle + TIME at top (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre9
**Commit:** `5d8c8a579`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23690564881
**What changed:**
- Root cause of left-side clip: clamping only ran during `ACTION_MOVE`. After tapping to toggle vertical mode (overlay grows tall) or after extra detail first appears, no re-clamp fired → overlay extended below screen bottom.
- Fix: `reclampPosition()` method added; uses `OnGlobalLayoutListener` (one-shot, self-removing) to re-clamp after layout settles. Called from `toggleOrientation()` and after extra detail visibility change.
- TIME row moved to first position in `extraDetailGroup` (right after divider) — immediately visible without scrolling past CPU cores / GPU stats.

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre9 — fix: clamp overlay to screen edges during drag (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre9
**Commit:** `a94c37c0f`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23690132917
**What changed:**
- `ACTION_MOVE` now clamps leftMargin/topMargin after each drag step using `v.getRootView()` dimensions
- All four edges clamped: left/top ≥ 0; right: leftMargin + width ≤ screenW; bottom: topMargin + height ≤ screenH
- Deleted pre1–pre7 releases and tags from GitHub

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre8 — refactor: pre6 vertical layout restored, BAT%/SKN/FAN removed (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre8
**Commit:** `2937d8939`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23689895717
**What changed:**
- BhFrameRating reverted to pre6 structure (toggles H↔V on self, original MATCH_PARENT extraDetailGroup)
- Extra detail only visible in vertical mode (`isVertical` guard restored)
- Removed: `tvBatPct`, `tvSkn`, `tvFan` fields, constructor rows, data reads, setText calls
- Removed methods: `readBatPercent()`, `readSkinTemp()`, `readFanSpeed()`
- Extra detail fields remaining: CPU cores, GPU info, GPU temp, RAM GB, SWAP, TIME

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre7 — fix: widen overlay + show extra detail in horizontal mode (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre7
**Commit:** `aaeab7e32`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23689573696
**What changed:**
- Outer BhFrameRating is now always VERTICAL; inner `mainRow` LinearLayout holds stats and toggles H↔V on tap — extra detail block sits below in both orientations
- Extra detail labels (except tvCpuCores) use `setSingleLine(true)` + `setEllipsize(END)`: no wrapping, container naturally grows to fit the longest line
- Removed all `isVertical` guards from extraDetailGroup visibility — extra detail shows in both modes
- `extraDetailGroup` LayoutParams: WRAP_CONTENT (was MATCH_PARENT, broken under new outer layout)

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre6 — fix: VerifyError crash opening Performance tab (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre6
**Commit:** `bc18a57c9`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23689336694
**What changed:**
- Root cause: `:cond_hud_switch_exists` is a join point reached by paths both with and without `check-cast v0, ViewGroup`. Verifier merges to common supertype `View`. My `addView()` on `ViewGroup` with a `View`-typed register → VerifyError crash when opening the Performance sidebar
- Fix: `check-cast v0, Landroid/view/ViewGroup;` added immediately before the checkbox `addView()` call

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre5 — feat: Extra Detailed checkbox for Winlator HUD (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre5
**Commit:** `3efcb78ad`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23689179502
**What changed:**
- "Extra Detailed" CheckBox added below Winlator HUD Style switch in Performance sidebar
- In vertical mode with checkbox on: shows per-core MHz (C0–C7), GPU model+clock, GPU temp, RAM GB, SWAP GB, BAT%, skin temp, fan speed, current time
- `extraDetailGroup` (vertical LinearLayout) appended to BhFrameRating — always GONE in horizontal mode
- `BhHudExtraDetailListener` saves `hud_extra_detail` pref; BhFrameRating reads it each 1s cycle
- `BhPerfSetupDelegate` creates CheckBox tagged `"bh_hud_extra_cb"` with 4dp top margin

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre4 — feat: tap-to-toggle vertical/horizontal FPS overlay (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre4
**Commit:** `1b7994096`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23688722622
**What changed:**
- Single tap on the overlay (no drag, < 10px movement) toggles between horizontal bar mode and vertical column mode
- `toggleOrientation()`: flips `LinearLayout` orientation, hides `" | "` separators (GONE) in vertical mode, updates `FpsGraphView` LayoutParams, re-centers label gravity
- `sepViews` List populated during construction to track all separator views
- Drag-to-reposition unchanged; `dragMoved` flag prevents tap/drag conflict

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre3 — FPS overlay: fix API label reading runtime engine name (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre3
**Commit:** `62aa09c68`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23687466600
**What changed:**
- Root cause: readApiName() read SP (configured renderer) — game had both DXVK and VKD3D set; DXVK key checked first so always showed DXVK regardless of actual renderer
- Fix: reflect into WineActivity.g → ActivityWineBinding.hudLayer → HUDLayer.b → UnifiedHUDView.a — exact same field original HUD renders; set by Wine at runtime via perf socket callback on first frame
- Shows "API" when field is "N/A" (before first frame presented)
- SharedPreferences import removed
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre2 — FPS overlay: CHRG label when charging, strip API version (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre2
**Commit:** `57de19552`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23687095100
**What changed:**
- BAT label shows "CHRG" when charging/full instead of disappearing; separator always visible
- API label stripped to type-only: "DXVK", "VKD3D", "WineD3D" — no version appended
- Removed `sepBat` field, `showName()` method, and `org.json.JSONObject` import
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`

## [pre] — v2.7.5-pre1 — FPS overlay: API label, FPS graph, charging detection (2026-03-28)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre1
**Commit:** `ffefa9c32`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23686862934 (3m46s)
**What changed:**
- `tvApi` TextView at far left: reads active renderer from `pc_g_setting{gameId}` SP (same source as GameHub) — `pc_ls_DXVK` → "DXVK name", `pc_ls_VK3k` → "VKD3D name", fallback "WineD3D"; mirrors PcSettingDataEntity.getShowName() logic
- `FpsGraphView` inner class at far right: 30-sample ring buffer, Canvas bar chart, bars shift green→red relative to max FPS in window
- `isCharging()` via ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED sticky broadcast (same method as HudDataProvider.b()): hides sepBat + tvBat entirely when device is charging or full
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`

## [pre] — v2.7.4-pre6 — fix: VRam Limit from SharedPreferences (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre6
**Commit:** `2a51abc2b`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23668107295
**What changed:**
- VRam Limit: switched from readWineEnv("WINEMU_MEMORY_LIMIT") to SharedPreferences — WINEMU_MEMORY_LIMIT not reliably in wine child /proc/environ
- New method getContainerVramInfo(Context): casts to WineActivity → WineActivityData.a (gameId) → SharedPreferences "pc_g_setting"+gameId → getInt("pc_ls_max_memory", 0)
- Returns "XXXX MB", "Unlimited" (0), or "N/A" (exception)

## [pre] — v2.7.4-pre5 — VRam Limit row + Sys RAM rename in Container Info (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre5
**Commit:** `0371035de`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23667070420
**What changed:**
- Added "VRam Limit:" row to Container Info: reads WINEMU_MEMORY_LIMIT from wine child /proc/pid/environ via readWineEnv(); shows "512 MB" or "Unlimited"
- Renamed "RAM:" label to "Sys RAM:" to clearly distinguish system RAM from VRam
- Container Info order: CPU Cores / Sys RAM / VRam Limit / Device / Android
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhTaskManagerFragment.smali`

## [pre] — v2.7.4-pre4 — fix: smali if-ltz for readWineEnv zero comparisons (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre4
**Commit:** `b258d3848`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23666627847
**What changed:**
- Fixed two invalid smali instructions in `readWineEnv()`: `if-lt vX, 0, :label` → `if-ltz vX, :label`
- `if-lt` requires two register operands; literal `0` is not a register — caused "mismatched input '0' expecting REGISTER" CI failure
- `readWineEnv()` now correctly reads WINEMU_CPU_AFFINITY from Wine child `/proc/<pid>/environ`
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhTaskManagerFragment.smali`

## [pre] — v2.7.4-pre4 — Wine Task Manager: container-accurate CPU + RAM (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre4
**Commit:** `3e444a792`  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23664109023
**What changed:**
- `getContainerCpuInfo()`: reads `WINEMU_CPU_AFFINITY` bitmask → `Integer.bitCount()` for assigned cores; falls back to `/proc/stat` count if unset/0; shows "CPU Cores: X / Y total"
- `getContainerRamInfo()`: reads `/proc/meminfo` for used MB + `WINEMU_MEMORY_LIMIT` env var for limit; shows "X MB used / Y MB limit" or "X MB used / Y MB total"
- Removed `getRamInfo()` (replaced)
- `onCreateView` CPU row: replaced 14-line inline StringBuilder block with single `invoke-static getContainerCpuInfo()`
- `onCreateView` RAM row: calls `getContainerRamInfo()` instead of `getRamInfo()`

## [pre] — v2.7.4-pre4 — Wine Task Manager: always-visible Container Info + two tabs (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre4 (earlier commits)
**What changed:**
- Wine Task Manager: Container Info (CPU/RAM/VRAM) always visible at top of panel
- Two tabs below: Applications (Wine infra non-.exe) + Processes (Windows .exe)
- Performance tab removed; Container Info built directly into root layout
- Applications/Processes routing fixed (was backwards vs Wine task manager convention)
- 10sp mixed-case button text so labels fit in tab bar width
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/drawable/sidebar_taskmanager.xml` (new)

## [pre] — v2.7.7-pre — 3-way API selector AlertDialog (2026-03-27)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.7-pre
**Commit:** `526ad99f9`
**What changed:**
- Replaced cycle-tap EmuReady toggle with AlertDialog showing all 3 API options as radio buttons
- `GameHubPrefs.setApiSource(I)V`: saves api_source + last_api_source prefs, clears caches, shows toast
- `BhApiSelectorListener` (new): `DialogInterface.OnClickListener` — calls setApiSource, dismisses dialog, updates switch visual
- `SettingSwitchHolder.w()` patched: bumped `.locals 5→9`, intercepts CONTENT_TYPE_API (0x1a), builds AlertDialog with 3 options pre-selected from getApiSource(), shows dialog, returns Unit early
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes6/…/GameHubPrefs.smali`, `patches/smali_classes16/…/BhApiSelectorListener.smali` (new), `patches/smali_classes10/…/SettingSwitchHolder.smali` (new)

**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.3-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `f16603864`
**What changed:**
- collectExeCandidates() gathers all qualifying .exes (excludes redist/unins/setup/crash/report/helper/dotnet/vcredist/directx), shallowest first

**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.3-pre (retagged)
**Commit:** `6f277b670`
**What changed:**
- Pre-install confirmation dialog (added in prior commit): shows game size (async-fetched) and available storage before download starts
- Cancel download button: Install button turns red and becomes Cancel during download; pressing it stops thread + deletes partial files from GOG install dir + resets to Install

## [stable] — v2.7.1 — Restore Steam card, standalone Normal variant, Normal(GHL) (2026-03-24)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.1
**Commit:** `029ae6b`
**What changed:**
- Steam card restored: removed versionName CI patch (kept 5.3.5) — was breaking My Games tab on all fresh installs
- Normal variant standalone (banner.hub), Normal(GHL) variant added (gamehub.lite)
- README rewrite, build-crossfire.yml removed, .gitignore added
**Files touched:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`
**CI result:** ✅ 9 APKs built

## [fix] — v2.7.1-pre2 — Remove versionName patch to restore Steam card (2026-03-24)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.1-pre2 (retagged)
**Commit:** `029ae6b`
**What changed:**
- Removed "Patch versionName" step from `build.yml`. Root cause: CI was patching `apktool.yml` versionName from `5.3.5` → release tag (e.g. `2.7.0`). GameHub sends versionName in server API calls (`SignUtils clientparams`). With `2.7.0` instead of `5.3.5`, a server/internal version gate suppressed the Steam card in My Games tab on fresh installs. Fix: keep original `5.3.5` from base APK decompile. BannerHub version is visible from the GitHub release tag.
**Files touched:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`
**CI result:** ✅ run 23518106008 (APK uploaded; release published manually after duplicate-release conflict)

## [fix] — v2.7.0 — Patch versionName, BannerHub labels, dynamic APK naming (2026-03-24)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0 (retagged — CI rebuild)
**Commit:** `5dd70e0`
**What changed:**
- Added "Patch versionName" step in prepare job: strips `v` from tag, sets correct versionName in apktool.yml so APK reports e.g. `2.7.0` internally
- Renamed all variant app labels from "GameHub Revanced ..." to "BannerHub ..." (Normal→BannerHub, PuBG→BannerHub PuBG, AnTuTu→BannerHub AnTuTu, alt-AnTuTu→BannerHub AnTuTu, PuBG-CrossFire→BannerHub PuBG CrossFire, Ludashi→BannerHub Ludashi, Genshin→BannerHub Genshin, Original→BannerHub Original)
- Sign step now uses `id: sign` + `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` to pass `apk_name` dynamically; upload step uses `steps.sign.outputs.apk_name`
- v2.7.0 release APKs rebuilt and re-uploaded; release description restored after CI

## [docs] — v2.7.1-pre — Thorough README rewrite (2026-03-23)
**Branch:** `main`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.1-pre (no new CI — docs only)
**Commit:** `3e62286`
**What changed:** Full README rewrite. Added Table of Contents. Every feature section expanded with technical depth: GOG tab covers auth flow, all three download pipelines (Gen 2 / Gen 1 / installer fallback), install flow, copy to downloads, uninstall. Component Manager covers card UI, all CRUD actions, format support table. Performance toggles section explains sysfs KGSL min_freq lock vs setSustainedPerformanceMode, CPU governor paths, and why root is required for the sysfs approach vs ioctl. Added gesture map table for RTS controls, core label table for CPU affinity, expanded Advanced tab and offline mode docs. Added FAQ (6 questions), expanded How It Works with classes12 bypass note.
**Files touched:** `README.md`
**CI result:** N/A (docs-only commit, no tag pushed)

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta69 — feat(gog): rename Launch button to Add on GOG game cards (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta69
**Commit:** `def0813`
**What changed:** `GogGamesFragment$2` line 393: `const-string v14, "Launch"` → `"Add"`. The button after install now reads "Add" to better reflect that it opens EditImportedGameInfoDialog to register the game with the launcher.
**Files touched:** `GogGamesFragment$2`

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta68 — fix(gog): fix v16 register error in checkmark propagation (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta68
**Commit:** `9d881a2`
**What changed:** beta67 failed because `v16` was used in non-range instructions (4-bit limit is v0-v15). Fix: create/setup checkmark in v13 (4-bit), persist to v16 via `move-object/from16 v16, v13` (8-bit dest OK), reload via `move-object/from16 v13, v16` when setting VISIBLE. v16 only appears in valid 8-bit/range contexts.
**Files touched:** `GogGamesFragment$2` only

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta67 — fix(gog): show ✓ Installed checkmark immediately when download completes (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta67
**Commit:** `3743330`
**What changed:** Checkmark "✓ Installed" now appears on the game card immediately when download finishes — no app restart required. Approach: checkmark TextView always created as GONE in `$2`, initial visibility set from gog_exe_ pref. Reference propagated through 5 levels: `$2`→`$6`→`$8`→`GogDownloadManager`→`$1`→`$3`. At progress=100 in `$3.run()`, `setVisibility(VISIBLE)` called on the checkmark ref. Root cause was that `$3` had no way to trigger UI update; this avoids a full card rebuild.
**Files touched:** `GogGamesFragment$2`, `GogGamesFragment$6`, `GogGamesFragment$8`, `GogDownloadManager`, `GogDownloadManager$1`, `GogDownloadManager$3`
**CI result:** ❌ smali v16 register error (fixed in beta68)

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta66 — fix(gog): card layout, uninstall path, post-uninstall refresh (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta66
**Commit:** `4540dc8`
**What changed:** (1) `$2` right-column LP height MATCH_PARENT→WRAP_CONTENT — cards grow to fit all content. (2) `$10` field `a` changed Context→GogGamesFragment; full install path built via `getFilesDir()/gog_games/{dirName}` (gog_dir_ stores name only, not path); after prefs clear, reads `access_token` and starts new `GogGamesFragment$1` thread to re-sync+rebuild cards. (3) `$3` passes fragment ref to `$10` constructor via `iget-object v10, p0, $3->a`.
**Files touched:** `GogGamesFragment$2`, `GogGamesFragment$3`, `GogGamesFragment$10`

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta65
**Commit:** `7214d44`
**What changed:** New `GogGamesFragment$10` (DialogInterface$OnClickListener): reads `gog_dir_{gameId}`, recursively deletes install dir via `deleteRecursive(File)`, removes prefs keys `gog_dir_`, `gog_exe_`, `gog_cover_`, `gog_gen_`, shows Toast "Uninstalled". `GogGamesFragment$3` wired up with `setNegativeButton("Uninstall", $10)` before `show()`.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta64 — feat(gog): Gen 1 / Gen 2 badge on each game card (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta64
**Commit:** `0a10b89`
**What changed:** Library sync ($1) now probes `builds?generation=2&system=windows` per game after adding it to the list. Stores `gog_gen_{gameId}=2` or `1` in bh_gog_prefs. HTTP/JSON errors silently caught (inner try_gen → :gen_check_done). Card builder ($2) reads the pref and adds a 10sp badge TextView: "Gen 2" (light blue 0xFF4FC3F7) or "Gen 1" (orange 0xFFFF9800). Skipped if value is 0.

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta63
**Commit:** `ee5173d`
**What changed:** After a game is installed, a green "✓ Installed" TextView (0xFF4CAF50, 10sp) appears on the card between the meta line and Install button. Reads gog_exe_{gameId} from bh_gog_prefs — only created and added if non-empty. Registers v11/v13/v14/v15 used as scratch at insertion point.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta62 — feat(gog): Gen 1 legacy download fallback (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta62
**Commit:** `d096da0`
**What changed:** Added Gen 1 download fallback when no Gen 2 build is found. New methods: `runGen1(token, gameId)` (8-step pipeline: builds?generation=1 → manifest → depot manifests → secure_link → downloadRange per file → finalize), `processGen1DepotManifest(json, list)` (parses depot.files[], skips support=true), `downloadRange(url, offset, size, outFile)` (Range: bytes=N-M HTTP download with 32KB buffer). :err_gen1 in run() now calls runGen1() instead of showing a toast. Finalize identical to Gen 2 (manifest json, prefs, exe stored, 100% Complete).
**Files touched:** `GogDownloadManager$1` (modified: :err_gen1 branch + 3 new private methods)

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta60
**Commit:** `9e717d3`
**What changed:** Tapping Launch now shows a cover-art preview AlertDialog (game title + cover image + Launch/Cancel) before handing off to B3(). During install, cover image is fetched from GogGame.imageUrl → saved as installDir/cover.jpg; path stored as gog_cover_{gameId} in bh_gog_prefs. GogGamesFragment$7 rewritten to load bitmap via BitmapFactory.decodeFile() and show dialog. New GogGamesFragment$9: DialogInterface$OnClickListener that calls B3(exePath).

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta58
**Commit:** `bf16ee5`
**What changed:** During the file download loop (45%→85%), status text now updates after each file: "Downloading files... X%" using `pct = fileIndex * 40 / totalFiles + 45`. Uses v3/v13/v14 (all scratch within loop). beta58 failed CI due to invalid `mul-int vA, vB, imm` opcode — fixed in beta59.

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta54
**Commit:** `bf5e521`
**What changed:** Added `setMinimumHeight(40dp)` on both Install (v8) and Launch (v12) buttons using the existing density float `v2`. Programmatic Buttons in GameHub's theme collapse to ~0dp height with WRAP_CONTENT because no default minHeight is applied.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta50 — feat(gog): Install button → size dialog → ProgressBar+statusTV flow (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta50
**Commit:** `3b45dd1`
**What changed:** Full card UI redesign: single Install button per card → tapping opens AlertDialog showing download size (MB) and available space (GB) with Cancel/Download buttons. Download confirm: Install hides (GONE), ProgressBar appears with statusTV below it showing step text (Fetching build info… → Fetching manifest… → Getting CDN link… → Downloading files… → Assembling… → Finishing up… → ✓ Complete). At 100%: bar+statusTV GONE, Launch button VISIBLE+enabled. If game already installed at card render: Install GONE, Launch shown immediately. fileSize:J field added to GogGame and populated from products/{id}?expand=downloads API.
**Files touched:** `GogGame`, `GogGamesFragment$1`, `GogGamesFragment$2`, `GogGamesFragment$6` (rewrite), `GogGamesFragment$8` (new), `GogDownloadManager`, `GogDownloadManager$1`, `GogDownloadManager$3` (rewrite)

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta49
**Commit:** `6a8b336`
**What changed:** Button labels changed from symbol "↓"/"▶" to text "Download"/"Launch". Button LP widened from 40×40dp to 90×40dp so text fits. ProgressBar replaced with a percentage TextView throughout the entire download chain — on click shows "0%", GogDownloadManager$3.run() builds "X%" string via Integer.toString+StringBuilder and calls setText; at progress≥100 TextView is hidden (GONE) and Launch button enabled.

**Commit:** `6508495`
**What changed:** Replace wide weight=1 button row (rendered as thin unreadable strips) with a vertical column of two 40dp×40dp square buttons pinned to the card's far right. ProgressBar now spans full width between thumbnail and button column. Buttons use ↓/▶ symbols with white text. .locals 17→16.

**Commit:** `89f26e0`
**What changed:** Moved Download and Launch buttons from the detail dialog to each game card. Card shows [Download][Launch] row + ProgressBar (GONE until download starts). Launch is disabled until GogDownloadManager$3 enables it at progress=100. Dialog simplified to info-only (Close only). GogGamesFragment$7 changed to View$OnClickListener. GogDownloadManager chain: TextView→Button for launch ref.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta46 — fix: manifest link URL clobbered by const/4 v4 null arg (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta46
**Commit:** `05ab138`
**What changed:** In `GogDownloadManager$1.run()`, Step 2 posted a 20% progress update using `const/4 v4, 0x0` as the null message argument — but v4 held the build manifest link URL from Step 1. The URL was silently overwritten with null before `fetchBytes(v4, v1)` was called, so `fetchBytes` returned null every time → "GOG: failed to read build manifest". Fix: use `v3` (free after JSONObject consumed) for the null message instead of `v4`.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta35 — fix: VerifyError in assembleFile — use v6 not v11 for size int (2026-03-22)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta35
**Commit:** `6a12617`
**What changed:** `assembleFile()` used `move-result v11` to store the `size` optInt, but v11=p0=this. On the second loop iteration, verifier sees v11 as Conflict (reference on loop-entry vs int in body) → rejects `invoke-direct {p0,...}` at offset 0x5C. Fix: use v6 (free after cdnPath consumed) instead of v11. Update `if-eq v10,v11` → `if-eq v10,v6`.

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta34
**Commit:** `5c76246`
**What changed:** `assembleFile()` had `move-result-wide v9` (from `File.length()J`) followed immediately by `if-nez v9`. Dalvik verifier rejects if-nez on `Long (Low Half)`: `[0x7E] type Long (Low Half) unexpected as arg to if-eqz/if-nez`. Fix: `long-to-int v9, v9` inserted between the two instructions.

**Commit:** `45f1f3a`
**What changed:** Install button moved from embedded scroll content to `setNegativeButton()` in standard AlertDialog button bar (always visible across from "Close").

Dialog shows Genre+Developer in info TV and a new description TV (Html.fromHtml, max 5 lines). Inner per-product try/catch skips one bad product without bailing the whole loop.

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta25
**What changed:** `ScrollView.arrowScroll()` only moves focus when `findFocus()` returns a non-null anchor. With no view focused after list load, the first D-pad press just scrolled instead of selecting a card. Fix: after the card loop, `requestFocus()` called on `getChildAt(0)` so first card is focused on load. `setFocusable(true)` (beta24) was necessary but not sufficient — this completes the fix.

**What changed:** `setFocusable(true)` added to each card view in `GogGamesFragment$2` immediately after `setClickable(true)`. Without `setFocusable`, Android's focus system had no targets to traverse and controller up/down did nothing. `v14` already held `true` from the preceding `setClickable` call — zero extra registers needed.

**What changed:** `GogTokenRefresh.smali` was sending the refresh grant as a POST with a form body. The GOG token endpoint uses GET with query params. Fix: remove `setDoOutput`, `Content-Type` header, `getOutputStream`/write; build full URL with params as query string. Also fixed truncated `client_secret` (last 32 hex chars were missing). `.locals` reduced 12→11.

(3) Title moved into dark custom view (bold 18sp, 16dp padding); `setTitle()` removed so no system title bar clash.

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta19
**What changed:** When the GOG library fetch returns non-200 (expired access_token), silently try a refresh_token grant before clearing the session. New `GogTokenRefresh.smali` static helper POSTs `grant_type=refresh_token` to `auth.gog.com/token`, saves the new `access_token` + `refresh_token` to SP, and returns the new token. `GogGamesFragment$1.smali` updated: on non-200, call `GogTokenRefresh.refresh(ctx)`, retry the library fetch with the new token if successful, otherwise clear both tokens and show the "Session expired" prompt. Also clears `refresh_token` from SP on full session expiry (previously only `access_token` was removed).

**What changed:** Cover art thumbnails (card list + dialog) showed blank placeholders. Two silent root causes: (1) GOG API may return image paths with JSON-escaped slashes (`\/\/images-4.gog.com\/hash`) → `MalformedURLException` in `java.net.URL` constructor, caught by `$4` catch-all. Fix: `String.replace("\\/", "/")` before URL assembly. (2) GOG CDN base hash paths have no extension and may not serve an image without a format suffix. Fix: append `_product_card_v2_mobile_slider_639.jpg` when no `.jpg`/`.webp`/`.png` extension present.

(2) `$3.onClick()` rewritten: replaces Toast with AlertDialog using `setView()` — custom view has 200dp cover art ImageView (async-loaded by `$4`), info TextView (Genre/Rating/DLC), blue store URL TextView. Dialog title = game title. (3) New `GogGamesFragment$4`: bg Runnable fetching Bitmap via HttpURLConnection + BitmapFactory, posts `$4$1` via `View.post()`.

**What changed:** (1) Game list overlapped the tab bar — root FrameLayout starts at y=0 with FocusTabLayout overlaying on top; first game title was hidden behind the tab strip. Fix: compute 56dp via DisplayMetrics.density, call setPadding(0, topPad, 0, 0) on the root FrameLayout in onCreateView. (2) Game titles had no click listener — plain TextViews are not tappable. Fix: new GogGamesFragment$3 (View.OnClickListener) created per item in $2's loop; tap shows a Toast with the game title. Saved title to v8 before v6 was reused; increased $2 .locals 8→9.

**What changed:** Previously an expired `access_token` caused `GogGamesFragment$1` to get a non-200 response (HTTP 401) which was treated identically to an empty game library — UI showed "No GOG games found" with no indication of why. Fix: `$1.run()` now calls `getResponseCode()` after connecting; on non-200, clears `access_token` from `bh_gog_prefs` SharedPreferences and posts `null` to UI instead of an empty ArrayList. `$2.run()` null-checks the list before calling `size()`: null → "Session expired - sign in again via the GOG side menu"; empty ArrayList → "No GOG games found" (unchanged).

**What changed:** Root cause of beta9 bug: `k3()`'s show/hide loop only processes `LazyFragment` instances. `GogGamesFragment` extended plain `Fragment`, so it was never hidden when switching back to My Games — its full-screen dark FrameLayout (MATCH_PARENT) covered all content permanently. Fix: change `.super` to `LazyFragment`, implement abstract `V()` = `refreshContent()` (initial load when tab first becomes visible), update `onResume()` super call. Removed premature `refreshContent()` from `onCreateView` (now handled by `V()` + `onResume()`).

**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta6
**What changed:** beta5 logcat confirmed `HTTP 400: {"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"The client credentials are invalid"}`. GOG has revoked `client_secret=9d85c43b1482497dbbce61f6e4aa173a` for third-party token exchanges. Fix: switch to OAuth2 implicit flow (`response_type=token`). Tokens arrive directly in the redirect URL fragment — no token exchange, no client_secret. `$1` now parses `#access_token=TOKEN&refresh_token=R&user_id=U` from the fragment using `Uri.parse("x://x?"+fragment)`. `$2` rewritten to 4-field constructor (activity, accessToken, refreshToken, userId); run() only fetches userData.json for username then saves all to SP. `$1` also extracted a `handleImplicitRedirect(Uri)` private helper to share logic between WebResourceRequest and deprecated String variants cleanly.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta5 — Fix GOG login: handle HTTP error responses (getErrorStream) (2026-03-21)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta5
**What changed:** Logcat from beta4 showed the GOG auth page reloading only 2 seconds after form submission — meaning the token exchange in $2 ran and failed almost immediately. Root cause: `readHttpResponse` called `getInputStream()` which throws `IOException` for HTTP 4xx/5xx responses; this jumped to catch_all → $4 error toast before we ever read the error body. Fix: check `getResponseCode()` first; if ≥ 400, use `getErrorStream()` to read the error body. Also added `Log.d("BH_GOG", "HTTP NNN: <body>")` so the next logcat will show exactly what GOG's token endpoint is returning, enabling final diagnosis.

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta4 — Fix GOG login: timeouts, retry on fail, loading feedback (2026-03-21)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta4
**What changed:** Four GOG login fixes based on logcat analysis (43s hang, blank screen after intercept, no retry on failure, UA mismatch).
- `GogLoginActivity$2`: `setConnectTimeout(15000)` + `setReadTimeout(15000)` on both HTTP connections (token POST + userData GET) — stops 43-second hang
- `GogLoginActivity$1`: after intercepting the redirect and starting the token thread, calls `webView.loadData(...)` to show "Logging in to GOG..." instead of blank/spinning page. Also added the deprecated `shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView,String)` override for Android < 8.0 compatibility (same logic as the `WebResourceRequest` variant)
- `GogLoginActivity$4`: fixed `.locals 2→3` (was referencing undeclared v2); added `webView.loadUrl(buildAuthUrl())` after the error toast so the login form reloads for a clean retry instead of leaving a blank screen
- `GogLoginActivity`: added `setUserAgentString("Mozilla/5.0 ... GOG Galaxy/2.0")` so GOG's server treats the WebView as Galaxy client
**Files touched:** `GogLoginActivity.smali`, `GogLoginActivity$1.smali`, `GogLoginActivity$2.smali`, `GogLoginActivity$4.smali`

## [beta] — v2.7.0-beta3 — GOG via side menu (DEX overflow fix) (2026-03-21)
**Branch:** `gog-beta`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta3
**What changed:** Moved GOG from the main tab bar (classes11, at DEX limit) to the left side menu (classes5, safe). beta1/beta2 failed: tab approach pushed classes11 to 65536 pool entries (unsigned short overflow). New approach: "GOG" item added as id=10 in HomeLeftMenuDialog side menu; clicking it opens new GogMainActivity (Activity, not Fragment). GogMainActivity shows login card or signed-in card; login opens WebView OAuth2 via GogLoginActivity.
**New files:** `GogMainActivity` (+$1 login, +$2 sign-out), `GogLoginActivity` (+$1 WebViewClient, +$2 TokenExchange, +$3 Finish, +$4 ErrorToast)
**Removed:** `BhGogTabCallback`, `GogFragment` (+$1 +$2) — no longer needed
**Patched:** `HomeLeftMenuDialog` (id=10 menu item + pswitch_10 → start GogMainActivity), `AndroidManifest.xml` (+GogMainActivity)
**Reverted:** `LandscapeLauncherMainActivity` — GOG tab injection removed (classes11 overflow risk)

## [ci] — Dynamic APK filenames (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `f238e3a`
**What changed:** All 3 CI workflows now produce `BannerHub-<tag>-<variant>.apk` instead of hardcoded `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-*.apk`. Matrix `apk:` field replaced with `variant:` (Normal/PuBG/AnTuTu/alt-AnTuTu/PuBG-CrossFire/Ludashi/Genshin/Original). Filename built from `${{ github.ref_name }}` + variant at sign time.

## [stable] — v2.6.3 — Stable release (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `18b36ed` (code) / `9dda08f` (README)  |  **Tag:** v2.6.3
**What changed:** Stable release of v2.6.2-pre3 through v2.6.2-pre7 line. New since v2.6.1: Component Manager UI rebuilt as card-based RecyclerView (search, swipe, source/type badges, count badge, empty state, auto-refresh); ✓ downloaded indicator in online repo lists (clears on removal); Remove All counts only BannerHub-managed components; compact cards (~20% smaller).
**CI result:** ✅ run 23381119419 — 8 APKs built successfully

## [pre] — v2.6.2-pre7 — Fix Remove All count + clear SP on component removal (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `18b36ed`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.2-pre7  |  **CI:** run 23380984014 (queued)
**What changed:** Bug A: `confirmRemoveAll()` now counts only `.bh_injected` components for the dialog message. Bug B: `$5.run()` writes a reverse key `"url_for:"+dirName → url` at injection time. `removeComponent()` and `removeAllComponents()` read this reverse key on removal to clear all 4 SP entries (`dirName`, `dirName:type`, `dl:url`, `url_for:dirName`) — clears the ✓ downloaded indicator in the online repo list.
**Files touched:** `ComponentDownloadActivity$5.smali` [ADD url_for reverse key write]; `ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [FIX confirmRemoveAll count; ADD SP cleanup in removeComponent + removeAllComponents]

## [pre] — v2.6.2-pre6 — Shrink component cards ~20% (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `af5a813`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.2-pre6  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23380774414
**What changed:** All dp values and text sizes in BhComponentAdapter.onCreateViewHolder scaled to ~80%. dp precomputations: 4→3, 8→6, 12→10, 36→29. Badge padding: 6→5dp. Text sizes: 15→12sp, 11→9sp, 20→16sp. No layout or logic changes.
**Files touched:** `BhComponentAdapter.smali` [SCALE dp + sp constants in onCreateViewHolder]

## [pre] — v2.6.2-pre5 — Fix source badge + refresh + type badge for Arihany items (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `26f5af5`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.2-pre5a  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23380498933
**What changed:** Four fixes: (1) Bug #1: Added onResume() to ComponentManagerActivity → list now refreshes immediately when returning from ComponentDownloadActivity. (2) Bug #2a: setMaxLines(1) changed to setMaxLines(2) on nameText in onCreateViewHolder → source badge (appended as \n+repo) is now visible. (3) Bug #2b: $5 now scans components dir post-injection using System.currentTimeMillis() timestamp to find newly created dir → correct SP key regardless of filename format; falls back to filename-based key if scan finds nothing. (4) Type badge fix: $5 writes dirName+":type" → type string (FEXCore/Box64/VKD3D/GPU/DXVK); adapter reads SP type override before keyword detection → Arihany FEXCore/DXVK show correct badge. (5) Double-extension bug fixed in onItemClick: endsWith check prevents appending ".wcp" if filename already ends in ".wcp".
**Files touched:** `ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [ADD onResume]; `BhComponentAdapter.smali` [setMaxLines 1→2, ADD type SP override in onBindViewHolder]; `ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` [ADD endsWith check in onItemClick]; `ComponentDownloadActivity$5.smali` [REWRITE run() with timestamp+scan+type]

## [pre] — v2.6.2-pre4 — Source tracking + ✓ installed indicator (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `11a6490`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.2-pre4  |  **CI:** ✅
**What changed:** SharedPreferences `"banners_sources"` added. ComponentDownloadActivity tracks which repo was selected (mCurrentRepo field, set in each sw0_N case). After successful injection in $5, writes baseName→repoName and "dl:url"→"1". showAssets() reads SP to prefix already-downloaded assets with ✓. BhComponentAdapter reads SP in onBindViewHolder to show "name\nrepoName" for BannerHub-downloaded components. pre3 kept as rollback baseline release.
**Files touched:** `ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` [ADD field mCurrentRepo; SET in sw0_N; ADD ✓ loop in showAssets]; `ComponentDownloadActivity$5.smali` [WRITE to SP after injection]; `BhComponentAdapter.smali` [ADD prefs field; LOAD in ctor; SHOW source in onBindViewHolder]

## [pre] — v2.7.9-pre — Rollback to v2.7.0-pre state (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `6eed029`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.9-pre  |  **CI:** ✅
**What changed:** Reverted ComponentManagerActivity.smali and BhComponentAdapter.smali to v2.7.0-pre state. Drops all button-to-header changes (v2.7.5–v2.7.8). Restores bottom bar with Add New + Download buttons.

## [pre] — v2.7.8-pre — Fix header centering: switch root to RelativeLayout (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `473955a`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.8-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 67991306650
**What changed:** Root layout changed from LinearLayout (weight=1 pattern) to RelativeLayout. LinearLayout weight distribution requires an EXACTLY MeasureSpec from the AppCompat subDecor; if AT_MOST is provided, the weight=1 content FrameLayout collapses to 0px and AppCompat centers the wrapper at the vertical middle of the window. RelativeLayout uses constraint-based geometry: header gets ALIGN_PARENT_TOP + setId(1), content gets BELOW(1) + ALIGN_PARENT_BOTTOM + MATCH_PARENT×MATCH_PARENT. No MeasureSpec dependency.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [MOD — buildUI() switched from LinearLayout to RelativeLayout root]

---

## [pre] — v2.7.7-pre — Fix header stuck at vertical center of screen (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `6266731`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.7-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23369636270
**What changed:** buildUI() layout fix. Removed setFitsSystemWindows(true) from root LinearLayout — was interfering with AppCompat subDecor's insets handling, offsetting the view to center. Changed setContentView(View) → setContentView(View, ViewGroup.LayoutParams(MATCH_PARENT, MATCH_PARENT)) to guarantee root fills window regardless of MeasureSpec from subDecor.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [MOD — removed setFitsSystemWindows call; setContentView now passes MATCH_PARENT×MATCH_PARENT LayoutParams]

## [pre] — v2.6.6-pre — Fix VerifyError crash on Component Manager open (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `495a264`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.6-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23365366484 (3m34s)
**What changed:** ART VerifyError crash fixed (from logcat). Two causes: (1) helper methods declared private but called via invoke-virtual — changed to public; (2) getFileName() overwrote Uri register with String[] before ContentResolver.query range call — fixed register ordering with move-object v1, p1 before array allocation.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [MOD — private→public on 7 methods; getFileName register fix]

## [pre] — v2.6.2-pre — Component Manager UI redesign: RecyclerView cards + search + swipe (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `56851cd`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.2-pre  |  **CI:** ❌ (register v16/v17 overflow in BhComponentAdapter)
**What changed:** Complete overhaul of ComponentManagerActivity UI. Replaces basic ListView with card-based RecyclerView. Each card shows component name + color-coded type badge (DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/FEX/GPU/WCP) with colored left accent strip. Live search bar (TextWatcher) filters cards in real time. Swipe LEFT removes, Swipe RIGHT backs up (ItemTouchHelper). Header has ← back, title, install count badge, "✕ All" remove-all. Bottom bar has "+ Add New" (blue) and "↓ Download" (green) buttons. Empty state shows 📦 emoji + help text when no components installed. Fully programmatic UI (no XML layouts).
**Files touched:**
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali` [REWRITE — new fields: recyclerView, adapter, emptyState, countBadge; new methods: dp(), buildUI(), buildHeader(), buildSearchBar(), buildContent(), buildEmptyState(), buildBottomBar(), makeBtn(), showComponents(), updateEmptyState(), onSearchChanged(), showOptionsDialog(), showTypeDialog(), removeFiltered(), backupFiltered(), getFileName()]
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhComponentAdapter.smali` [NEW — RecyclerView.Adapter: updateComponents(), filter(), getFiltered(), onItemTapped(), getTypeName(), getTypeColor(), onCreateViewHolder(), onBindViewHolder(), getItemCount()]
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhComponentAdapter$ViewHolder.smali` [NEW — ViewHolder with onClick delegation to adapter.onItemTapped()]

## [pre] — v2.5.6-pre — Download progress indicator in ComponentDownloadActivity (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `1fc4505`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.6-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23346364788 (3m~)
**What changed:** Added `mProgressBar` (indeterminate) to ComponentDownloadActivity. Shown during repo fetching ("Fetching X...") and file download ("Downloading: `<filename>`"). Hidden on `showRepos()`, `showCategories()`, `showAssets()`. Status text during download now shows "Downloading: `<filename>`" instead of just "Downloading...". Matches bh-lite behaviour.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` [MOD — +56 lines: field, onCreate setup, visibility toggling in 6 fetch cases + download start + 3 nav methods]

## [pre] — v2.5.5-pre — Show component description in game settings picker (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `d8ae34f`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.5-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23345802544 (3m30s)
**What changed:** `appendLocalComponents()` now calls `entity.getBlurb()` and passes the result to `DialogSettingListItemEntity.setDesc()`. Locally installed components now show their description text under the component name in the game settings component picker. `EnvLayerEntity.getBlurb()` is not obfuscated in 5.3.5. Blurb value comes from `profile.json` `"description"` field stored at inject time.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentInjectorHelper.smali` [MOD — +5 lines in appendLocalComponents after setDownloaded]

## [pre] — v2.5.3-pre — Fix: Grant Root Access patches missing from build-quick.yml (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `c7ecc4d`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.3-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23339561713 (3m38s)
**What changed:** Pre-releases use build-quick.yml but the 3 Grant Root Access Python smali patches were only added to build.yml. As a result the button was never added to the settings list and getContentName() never returned "Grant Root Access". Added the identical Python patch step to build-quick.yml targeting apktool_out/ instead of apktool_out_base/.
**CI result:** ✅ passed

---

## [pre] — v2.5.2-pre — Settings: Grant Root Access button (port from bh-lite) (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `493f9ae`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.2-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23338789938 (3m38s)
**What changed:** Ported the explicit root-grant dialog from BannerHub Lite. Added "Grant Root Access" button to Settings → Advanced (contentType=0x64). Shows a full warning dialog; on confirmation runs `su -c id` via a background thread and stores `root_granted` in `bh_prefs`. BhPerfSetupDelegate now reads this pref instead of running a live `isRootAvailable()` check on every sidebar open. 5 new inner-class smali files in patches/smali_classes16. 3 Python string patches added to build.yml CI for SettingBtnHolder.w(), SettingItemEntity.getContentName(), SettingItemViewModel.k(). NOTE: patches were missing from build-quick.yml — fixed in v2.5.3-pre.
**CI result:** ✅ passed (but missing build-quick.yml patches — see v2.5.3-pre)

## [stable] — v2.5.1 — Perf crash guard + root-gated toggles (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `d0a6fcb`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.1
**What changed:** (A) try/catch guard on both BH on-launch perf re-apply blocks — prevents `setSustainedPerformanceMode()` crash on unsupported devices. (C) `BhPerfSetupDelegate` root check via `isRootAvailable()` — no-root devices see perf toggles at 0.5f alpha, non-interactive. Float literal bug fixed (`const/high16` → `const 0x3f000000`).

## [pre] — v2.5.1-pre — Fix: perf launch crash guard + grey out without root (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `d0a6fcb`  |  **Tag:** v2.5.1-pre
**What changed:** (A) Wrapped both BannerHub on-launch re-apply blocks (Sustained Perf + Max Adreno) in try/catch — `setSustainedPerformanceMode()` throws on unsupported devices, previously crashing container launch. (C) Fixed `BhPerfSetupDelegate` float literal bug (`const/high16` → `const 0x3f000000`); added `isRootAvailable()` root check; no-root devices see both performance toggles at 0.5f alpha with no click listener.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes15/com/xj/winemu/WineActivity.smali` [MOD — try/catch around BH re-apply blocks]; `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali` [MOD — isRootAvailable()Z, float fix, root guard]

**Commit:** `8e78d4f`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.9-pre
**What changed:** Renamed toggle to "Sustained Perf (Root+)". Now calls `Window.setSustainedPerformanceMode()` first (no-root, silent if device doesn't support it), then always attempts CPU governor via `su -c` (root users get guaranteed visible effect). onCreate re-apply block updated identically.

## [pre] — v2.4.8-pre — Fix: su -c flag missing — root toggles had no effect (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `0016e60`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.8-pre
**What changed:** Both Sustained Performance and Max Adreno Clocks toggles silently did nothing. Root cause: all su commands used a 2-element array `["su", "command"]` which passes the shell script as a username to su rather than as a shell command to execute. Fixed to 3-element `["su", "-c", "command"]`. Also replaced `Window.setSustainedPerformanceMode()` (silently a no-op on most Android devices — requires OEM enablement) with a CPU governor approach: sets all CPU cores to `performance` governor on enable, `schedutil` on disable. Max Adreno enable command simplified from `MAX=$(cat ...)` variable expansion to `cat max_freq > min_freq` (direct redirection, no variable needed). All four locations patched: `toggleSustainedPerf()`, `toggleMaxAdreno()`, and both re-apply blocks in `o2()` (onCreate).
**Root cause analysis:** `Runtime.exec(String[])` takes program + args; `["su", "cmd"]` = `su "cmd"` (username lookup, fails silently). Must be `["su", "-c", "cmd"]`. `setSustainedPerformanceMode` additionally requires OEM HAL support and is a no-op on most devices.

## [pre] — v2.4.7-pre — Fix: restore R$id.smali (iv_bci_launcher) (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `cbf3efa`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.7-pre
**What changed:** App crashed on launch with `java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: No field iv_bci_launcher of type I in class Lcom/xj/landscape/launcher/R$id`. Caused by `rm -rf patches/smali_classes9/` (intended to remove failed SidebarPerformanceFragment patch) which also deleted `R$id.smali` — the patch that adds `iv_bci_launcher` to the R$id class, required by BciLauncherClickListener and LandscapeLauncherMainActivity. Restored from git history (commit `4fbf4d9`).
**Root cause analysis:** `rm -rf` on smali_classes9 removed both the bad SidebarPerformanceFragment patch AND the critical R$id patch. Should have removed only the specific file.

## [pre] — v2.4.6-pre — Sustained Perf + Max Adreno Clocks toggles in Performance sidebar (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `5835d3c`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.6-pre
**What changed:** Moved Sustained Performance toggle from ComponentManagerActivity to the in-game Performance sidebar tab. Added Max Adreno Clocks (Root) toggle below it. Both use BhPerfSetupDelegate pattern (self-wiring View in layout XML, wires siblings in onAttachedToWindow) to avoid touching smali_classes9 (at dex limit). WineActivity gains toggleSustainedPerf() and toggleMaxAdreno() static methods. Max adreno command: locks kgsl-3d0 min_freq = max_freq via su.
**Root cause analysis:** smali_classes9 is at 65535 method reference limit — adding any new methods causes build failure. BhPerfSetupDelegate puts all new code in smali_classes16 with zero additions to classes9.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali` [NEW], `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/MaxAdrenoClickListener.smali` [NEW], `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/SustainedPerfSwitchClickListener.smali` [NEW], `patches/smali_classes15/com/xj/winemu/WineActivity.smali` [MOD], `patches/res/layout/winemu_sidebar_hub_type_fragment.xml` [NEW patch], `patches/res/values/strings.xml` [MOD], `patches/res/values/ids.xml` [MOD], `patches/res/values/public.xml` [MOD]

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta6b — Fix IllegalAccessError on Apply/No Limit (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `41deadb`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta6b
**What changed:** Crash: `IllegalAccessError: Field 'id' is inaccessible` — private backing fields on `DialogSettingListItemEntity` (classes12) cannot be set via `iput` from classes16 on ART 14. Fix: use the full Kotlin defaults constructor `invoke-direct/range {v7..v32}` with bitmask `0x3ffffa` (provide id+isSelected, default rest) — same pattern as PcGameSettingOperations. Also add `move-object/from16 v3/v6, p0` at method start: with `.locals 33`, p0=v33 which exceeds the 4-bit iget-object limit.
**Root cause analysis:** Cross-dex private field access blocked by ART 14. Must use constructor or public setter — no public setters exist (Kotlin val/var with private backing), so full defaults ctor is the only option.

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta5 — Immediate UI refresh via DialogSettingListItemEntity (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `77c6cf2`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta5
**What changed:** After saving, construct `new DialogSettingListItemEntity{id=newMask, isSelected=true}` and call `callback.invoke(entity)`. This matches the type the original `e()` passes to `u0.invoke()`. Settings row label now refreshes immediately after Apply/No Limit — no back-out required.

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta4 — Remove callback invocation to fix j3 NPE crash; 80% height; smaller text (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `401e43b`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta4
**What changed:** Root cause of NPE: `u0` lambda (UI refresh callback) expects `DialogSettingListItemEntity`, not `View` — passing View caused `j3.checkNotNullParameter` on a null intermediate. Fix: removed `callback.invoke()` from $2 and $3 entirely; value is still saved via `SPUtils.m()`. Also: height raised to 80% (`heightPixels * 4/5`); labels wrapped in `Html.fromHtml("<small>...</small>")` for smaller text. $2/$3 constructors simplified (no View/Function1 fields, no invoke-direct/range).

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta3 — Fix invoke-direct/range for $2 6-arg constructor (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `48aac66`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta3
**What changed:** Fixed CI failure from beta2 — Dalvik non-range `invoke-direct` max 5 registers; `CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.<init>` takes 6. Rewrote register layout: move args into contiguous v7..v11, new-instance at v6, call `invoke-direct/range {v6 .. v11}`. `$3` (5 regs) kept as regular invoke-direct.

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta2 — Fix NPE crash + dialog height limit (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `249c1c1`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta2  |  **CI:** ❌ (smali 5-reg limit)
**What changed:** (1) NPE fix: `j3` callback expects non-null `android.view.View`; changed `show()` signature to `(View, ...)` and pass anchor View from `SelectAndSingleInputDialog$Companion.d()` through $2/$3 as callback argument. (2) Height limit: after `builder.show()` get `AlertDialog.getWindow()`, call `setLayout(WRAP_CONTENT, heightPixels * 70%)` via `mul-int/lit16`/`div-int/lit16`. CI failed due to invoke-direct 6-register limit (fixed in beta3).

## [beta] — v2.4.2-beta1 — Multi-select CPU core dialog (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `fe2e2a1`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta1
**What changed:** Replaced single-select CPU core preset list with a multi-select checkbox dialog (`AlertDialog.setMultiChoiceItems()`). Intercept added to `SelectAndSingleInputDialog$Companion.d()` for `CONTENT_TYPE_CORE_LIMIT` — calls `CpuMultiSelectHelper.show()` instead of OptionsPopup. Helper reads current mask, pre-checks boxes accordingly, shows 8 individual core checkboxes (Core 0-7). "Apply" saves OR-combined bitmask; "No Limit" saves 0. `D(I)` updated to dynamically build label (e.g. "Core 4 + Core 7 (Prime)") for custom combinations.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/.../CpuMultiSelectHelper{,$1,$2,$3}.smali` [NEW], `patches/smali_classes2/.../SelectAndSingleInputDialog$Companion.smali` [NEW PATCH], `patches/smali_classes4/.../PcGameSettingOperations.smali`

## [beta] — v2.4.1-beta2 — CPU core selector: fix const/4 range error for Core 3 (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `c657566`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.1-beta2
**What changed:** Fixed smali assembler error — `const/4` only holds -8 to 7; value 8 (Core 3 id) requires `const/16`. Two occurrences fixed: in A() (Core 3 entry, v8) and in D(I) (Core 3 match, v0). CI now passes.

## [beta] — v2.4.1-beta1 — CPU core selector: bitmask-based specific core selection (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `eb55f63`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.1-beta1
**What changed:** Replaced count-based CPU core limit with bitmask-based specific core selection. EnvironmentController.d() patched to pass stored value directly as WINEMU_CPU_AFFINITY (bypasses (1<<count)-1 formula). A() replaced with 11-entry fixed list: No Limit, Cores 4-7 (Performance), Cores 0-3 (Efficiency), Core 0–Core 7 (Prime). D(I) returns correct display label per bitmask value.

## [stable] — v2.4.0 — In-app downloader, VRAM unlock, offline PC settings (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `9fa49f1`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.0
**What changed:** Stable release packaging all pre-releases since v2.3.5. Features: in-app component downloader (The412Banner Nightlies + Arihany WCPHub), VRAM limit unlock (6/8/12/16 GB) with correct display and checkmark, offline PC game settings fix. README rewritten to reflect full feature set.
**Files touched:** README.md (rewrite)

## [fix] — v2.3.10-pre — Fix VRAM display string and isSelected checkmark (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `86207ca`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.10-pre
**What changed:** Selecting 6/8/12/16 GB VRAM appeared to revert to "Unlimited" due to two display bugs. (1) `F0()` had no if-eq branches for values > 4096, returning the "No Limit" string — fixed by adding cases for 0x1800/0x2000/0x3000/0x4000. (2) `l0()` always set `isSelected=false` for the new entries — fixed by calling `G0()` once into v3 (int) and comparing v3 against each MB value via v4. The value was already being saved correctly to MMKV; these were purely display bugs.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes4/com/xj/winemu/settings/PcGameSettingOperations.smali`

## [fix] — v2.3.9-pre — Fix VerifyError crash from invalid if-ne in VRAM l0() (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `c83dcb0`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.9-pre
**What changed:** v2.3.8-pre caused a VerifyError that crashed PC game settings and uninstall. The new VRAM entries used `if-ne v0, vN` where v0 was a DialogSettingListItemEntity ref (clobbered) vs integer — invalid in Dalvik. Fixed by removing the selected-state check for new entries (always false/not selected). No functional impact on the VRAM options themselves.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes4/com/xj/winemu/settings/PcGameSettingOperations.smali`

## [feat] — v2.3.8-pre — Unlock higher VRAM limits in PC game settings (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `cb56d1b`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.8-pre
**What changed:** VRam Limit dropdown was capped at 4 GB. Added 6 GB, 8 GB, 12 GB, and 16 GB options by appending new `DialogSettingListItemEntity` entries to `PcGameSettingOperations.l0()` in a new patch file.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes4/com/xj/winemu/settings/PcGameSettingOperations.smali` [NEW]

## [fix] — v2.3.7-pre — Offline mode: catch NoCacheException in PC game settings (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `36e0180`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.7-pre
**What changed:** When offline, opening PC game settings crashed with `NoCacheException` from `landscape-api.vgabc.com` (getContainerList + getComponentList), making menus non-interactive. Fixed by wrapping `ResultKt.throwOnFailure()` in try-catch at the two coroutine resume points (pswitch_8 for getContainerList, pswitch_6 for getComponentList) with empty fallbacks (ArrayList / `"{}"`). Settings menus now open and remain interactive offline.

## [fix] — no tag — Restore patches/ to v2.3.5 + classes12 bypass all workflows (2026-03-17)
**Commits:** `b42c452` (patches fix), `f66a6a4` (crossfire bypass), `5875eb8` (build.yml bypass), `9b4f0f5` (build-quick.yml bypass)
**What changed:** GitHub Actions environment changed overnight causing smali reassembly failures (dex index limit). Fixed by:
1. Extracting original `classes12.dex` from base APK and injecting it post-rebuild, bypassing smali reassembly for that dex — applied to all 3 workflows (build.yml ✅ passed, build-quick.yml, build-crossfire.yml)
2. Removed 5 extra smali files from patches/ that were left by the bad revert of bbf4d43 (duplicate injection points in wrong dex locations for new APK experiment)
3. Saved `apktool_out_base` artifact from v2.3.5 CI run as permanent release `apktool-out-base-v2.3.5` (219MB) before it expired
**Files touched:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-crossfire.yml`, `patches/smali_classes4/`, `patches/smali_classes7/`, `patches/smali_classes11/`, `patches/smali_classes12/`, `patches/smali_classes14/`

---

## [ci] — no tag — Add workflow_dispatch to build-quick.yml (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `ff9267d`
**What changed:** Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger to `build-quick.yml` so the quick CI build (Normal APK only) can be run manually without a tag. Triggered immediately to verify base APK integrity (CI run `23188227052`, in progress).
**Files touched:** `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`

## [feat] — v2.3.5 (docs) — Standalone Component Manager patch + build guide (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `d71bfc7`
**What changed:** Added `component-manager-patch/` — a self-contained patch directory for applying ONLY the Component Manager feature to GameHub 5.3.5 ReVanced (no RTS controls, no BCI button, no other BannerHub changes).
- `patches/` — 15 new smali files (ComponentManagerActivity, ComponentInjectorHelper, WcpExtractor, ComponentDownloadActivity $1-$9) + 2 modified originals (HomeLeftMenuDialog, GameSettingViewModel$fetchList$1)
- `build.yml` — full GitHub Actions CI workflow (decompile → patch → Python manifest injection → rebuild → sign → release)
- `BUILD_GUIDE.md` — features overview, repo structure, quick start, manual build steps, exact injection diffs for both modified original files, AndroidManifest additions, key constraints table
**Files touched:** `component-manager-patch/` (19 files created)

## [docs] — v2.3.5 (stable) — Triple-check build log corrections (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `362ef4d`
**What changed:** Corrected three errors in COMPONENT_MANAGER_BUILD_LOG.md identified during triple-check:
1. Entry 021 commit hash: `5808a2a` → `d6d9965` (first title/padding attempt was not the built commit)
2. Entry 023/024 ordering: entries were written in wrong order; 023 (v2.2.8-pre Remove option) now precedes 024 (v2.2.9-pre RTS shrink)
3. Entries 019/020: gap note added — these numbers were never assigned (no feature commits between v2.2.6-pre and v2.2.7-pre)

## SESSION SUMMARY — 2026-03-16
Implemented in-app component downloader. Full journey: initial fetch (Nightlies only) → Looper crash fix ($5 InjectRunnable) → multi-repo/category redesign → Arihany added (Releases API failed, switched to pack.json via $6) → cleaned to Arihany-only → promoted to v2.3.1-pre.

**Architecture:**
- `ComponentDownloadActivity` — 3-mode Activity (0=repos, 1=categories, 2=assets); mode-driven ListView; `onBackPressed()` navigates backwards
- `$1` — FetchRunnable: GitHub Releases API (finds first `nightly-*` tag); used by Nightlies-style repos
- `$2` — ShowCategoriesRunnable: posts `showCategories()` to UI thread after fetch
- `$3` — DownloadRunnable: streams file to cacheDir, posts `$5`
- `$4` — CompleteRunnable: shows Toast + finish()
- `$5` — InjectRunnable: calls `ComponentInjectorHelper.injectComponent()` on UI thread (Looper fix)
- `$6` — PackJsonFetchRunnable: fetches flat JSON array (type/verName/remoteUrl), skips Wine/Proton, extracts filename from URL last segment; used by Arihany/StevenMXZ-style repos
- `detectType(String)I` — case-insensitive (toLowerCase first); box64→94, fex→95, vkd3d→13, turnip/adreno/driver→10, default DXVK→12
- `startFetch(String)` — spawns $1 thread (GitHub Releases API format)
- `startFetchPackJson(String)` — spawns $6 thread (flat JSON array format)

**Key lessons:**
- Arihany has no `nightly-*` tags — Releases API returns empty; must use pack.json
- Wine/Proton type ints unknown in GameHub — skip to avoid wrong-type injection
- `injectComponent()` calls Toast internally → must run on UI thread (Looper requirement)
- `val$type:I` primitive fields must NOT have trailing `;` in smali type descriptors

## [feat] — v2.3.4-pre — Add The412Banner Nightlies repo (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `babe5f9`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.4-pre  |  **CI:** ✓ (run `23151833249`, 3m36s)

### What changed
- Added "The412Banner Nightlies" at index 5 in showRepos() (Back shifted to index 6)
- `sw0_5` handler: clears lists, sets status text, calls `startFetchPackJson("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The412Banner/Nightlies/refs/heads/main/nightlies_components.json")`
- Uses `$6` PackJsonFetchRunnable (flat JSON array: type/verName/remoteUrl) — same as Arihany
- `showRepos()` array size 6→7; `sw0_data` packed-switch extended to 6 entries

### Files changed
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` [MOD]

## [fix] — v2.3.3-pre — Fix: GPU driver variants with same version collide on install (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `a80947d`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.3-pre  |  **CI:** ✓ (run `23149773741`, 3m41s)

### What changed
- `ComponentDownloadActivity.onItemClick()` mode=2: after storing `mDownloadUrl`, parse URL last path segment to extract extension (e.g. `.zip`) and append to `mDownloadFilename`
- **Bug fixed:** `Turnip_MTR_v2.0.0-b_Axxx` and `Turnip_MTR_v2.0.0-p_Axxx` both stripped to `Turnip_MTR_v2.0` by `stripExt()` because the cache filename had no real extension — `stripExt()` found the last `.` inside the version number instead
- **Fix:** cache file now saved as `Turnip_MTR_v2.0.0-b_Axxx.zip`; `stripExt()` correctly strips `.zip`; both variants get distinct names and coexist in GameHub menus
- `.locals 2` → `.locals 4` in `onItemClick` to accommodate v2/v3 used for extension extraction

### Files changed
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` [MOD]

## ~~[feat] — v2.3.1-pre9 — Split GPU Drivers into Kimchi and StevenMXZ repos (2026-03-16)~~
**Commit:** `5989ef4`  |  ~~Tag: v2.3.1-pre9~~ DELETED

### What changed
- Removed combined "GPU Drivers (Kimchi+StevenMXZ)" repo
- Added "Kimchi GPU Drivers" (sw0_1) → `kimchi_drivers.json` flat array

## ~~[fix] — v2.3.1-pre8 — Fix blank component name after ZIP inject (2026-03-16)~~
**Commit:** `a893204`  |  ~~Tag: v2.3.1-pre8~~ DELETED

### Root cause
`getDisplayName(ctx, uri)` queries ContentResolver `_display_name`. For `file://` URIs created by `Uri.fromFile()` (used by $3 DownloadRunnable after caching to cacheDir), ContentResolver returns null cursor → `v7 = ""` → `stripExt("") = ""` → blank name in toast and GameHub's component list.

### Fix
Modified `getDisplayName` to fall back to `uri.getLastPathSegment()` when ContentResolver returns empty. This returns the cached filename (e.g. `"v840 — Qualcomm_840_adpkg.zip"`) for file:// URIs. `stripExt()` then gives `"v840 — Qualcomm_840_adpkg"` as the component name. Also fixed the exception handler path (same fallback applied when ContentResolver throws).

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentInjectorHelper.smali` — `getDisplayName()`: fallback to `Uri.getLastPathSegment()` at `:ret` and `:dn_err`

---

## ~~[pre] — v2.3.1-pre3 — Switch Kimchi to Nightlies drivers.json mirror (2026-03-16)~~
**Commit:** `2b7c3a5`  |  ~~Tag: v2.3.1-pre3~~ DELETED

### What changed
- `$7` now fetches `Nightlies/kimchi/drivers.json` instead of GitHub Releases API
- JSON format: root JSONObject → `releases[]`, each with `tag` + `assets[]` with `mirror_url`
- Repo label: "Kimchi GPU Drivers"; status: "Fetching Kimchi GPU Drivers..."
- 154 releases / 200 assets, served from Nightlies mirror (no API rate limits)

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$7.smali` — KimchiDriversRunnable (parse JSONObject root, `tag`/`mirror_url` fields)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` — repo label + URL in sw0_1

---

## ~~[pre] — v2.3.1-pre2 — Fix $7 register limit (2026-03-16)~~
**Commit:** `07aa664`  |  ~~Tag: v2.3.1-pre2~~ DELETED

### What changed
- `.locals 15` (not 16) so p0 maps to v15 within 4-bit instruction range
- v5 reused as asset url after responseStr consumed into JSONArray

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$7.smali`

## [beta] — v2.3.1-beta7 — Add K11MCH1 AdrenoToolsDrivers repo (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `07e0583`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta7

### What changed
- Added K11MCH1 AdrenoToolsDrivers as 2nd repo in component downloader
- New `$7` (AllReleasesRunnable): fetches all GitHub releases (`?per_page=100`), iterates every release's assets array, labels each entry as `"tagName / assetName"`, accepts `.wcp`/`.zip`/`.xz`
- Added `startFetchAllReleases(String)` method wiring to `$7`
- `showRepos()` expanded 2→3 items: Arihany WCPHub / K11MCH1 AdrenoToolsDrivers / ← Back
- `sw0_1` handler + `sw0_data` packed-switch extended to 2 entries
- Assets appear under "GPU Driver / Turnip" category (detectType matches "adreno" in filename)

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` — showRepos(), sw0_1 handler, sw0_data, startFetchAllReleases()
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$7.smali` (new — AllReleasesRunnable)

**Commit:** `b0cf210`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta5  |  **CI run:** `23123388373` (✓, Normal APK, package=`banner.hub`)

### What changed
- Removed "Nightlies by The412Banner" from showRepos() array and sw0 switch (array 3→2, sw0_1 deleted, sw0_0 now = Arihany)
- Deleted GitHub releases for beta1/beta2/beta3 (tags already removed)

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` — showRepos() + sw0 switch table

---

## [beta] — v2.3.1-beta4 — Fix Arihany: switch to pack.json format (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `71f74fd`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta4  |  **CI run:** `23123229797` (✓, Normal APK, package=`banner.hub`)

### What changed
- Arihany WCPHub had no `nightly-*` tagged releases, so `$1` (GitHub Releases API fetch) returned nothing
- New `$6` (PackJsonFetchRunnable): fetches `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arihany/WinlatorWCPHub/refs/heads/main/pack.json` (flat JSONArray with type/verName/remoteUrl fields)
- Skips entries where `type` = "Wine" or "Proton" (no known GameHub type int for these)
- Extracts filename from last URL path segment (e.g., "box64-bionic-0.3.8.wcp") for detectType compatibility
- Added `startFetchPackJson(String)` method to ComponentDownloadActivity; sw0_1 now calls it

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` — added startFetchPackJson() + updated sw0_1 URL and method call
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$6.smali` (new — PackJsonFetchRunnable)

---

## [beta] — v2.3.1-beta2 — Case-insensitive detectType (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `e2887e1`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta2  |  **CI run:** `23122723773` (✓ 3m54s, Normal APK, package=`banner.hub`)

### What changed
- `detectType()` already had `toLowerCase()` from commit `14a9471` — confirmed correct. Tagged beta2 as clean release separate from beta1 iterations.
- No code changes from beta1; this tag exists to give users a stable, clearly-named release to test.

### Files touched
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` only

---

## [beta] — v2.3.1-beta1 — Multi-repo/category component downloader (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `14a9471`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta1 (retagged)  |  **CI run:** `23122285193` (✓ 3m42s, Normal APK, package=`banner.hub`)

### What changed
- "↓ Download from Online Repos" replaces the old single-repo entry — launches ComponentDownloadActivity with a 3-level navigation flow
- **Level 1 — Repo selection:** "Nightlies by The412Banner" → fetches `https://api.github.com/repos/The412Banner/Nightlies/releases`
- **Level 2 — Category selection:** DXVK / VKD3D-Proton / Box64 / FEXCore / GPU Driver / Turnip (with ← Back)
- **Level 3 — Asset list:** filtered by `detectType()` match; tap to download and inject; empty category shows toast and stays on category screen
- `$1` FetchRunnable parameterized with `val$url` — passes URL from `startFetch(String)` instead of hardcoding
- `$2` ShowCategoriesRunnable now just calls `showCategories()` (moved ArrayAdapter setup inside the method)
- `$5` InjectRunnable created to run `injectComponent` on UI thread (Looper crash fix from prior commit preserved)
- `onBackPressed()`: mode 2 → showCategories, mode 1 → showRepos, mode 0 → super

## [ci] — post-v2.3.0 — CI fixes + CrossFire variant + pre/beta isolation (2026-03-15)
**Commits:** `78c6aae` (manifest fix), `ce0dcda` (CrossFire + workflow), `f12ea94` (pre/beta package)

### What changed
- **Manifest package conflict fix** — replaced two targeted seds with a single global `sed -i "s/gamehub\.lite/$PKG/g"` on AndroidManifest.xml for all non-Normal variants in `build.yml`. Fixes install conflicts with GameHub Lite 5.1.4 caused by `gamehub.lite.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` custom permission declaration colliding with differently-signed installs
- **8th APK variant added** — `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-PuBG-CrossFire.apk` (`com.tencent.tmgp.cf`, label "GameHub Revanced PuBG CrossFire") added to `build.yml` matrix; enables frame generation on Vivo phones running OriginOS 6 China ROM
- **`build-crossfire.yml`** — new standalone `workflow_dispatch` workflow that builds only the CrossFire APK and uploads it directly to the v2.3.0 release
- **Pre/beta package isolation** — `build-quick.yml` now patches package name to `banner.hub` for all pre-release and beta builds, preventing accidental overwrites of stable installs
- **v2.3.0 APKs rebuilt** — all 7 (now 8) APKs re-uploaded to v2.3.0 release with the manifest fix applied; release description updated with CrossFire entry and Vivo OriginOS 6 framegen note

### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — global manifest sed + CrossFire matrix entry
- `.github/workflows/build-crossfire.yml` (new)
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml` — banner.hub package for pre/beta

## [beta] — v2.3.1-beta1 — In-app component downloader (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `1cdc468`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.1-beta1 (retagged at `407bedf`)  |  **CI run:** `23121795097` (Normal APK, package=`banner.hub`)

### Bug fixes
- `$3` (DownloadRunnable): moved `injectComponent` call out of background thread into new `$5` (InjectRunnable) posted via `runOnUiThread` — fixes "Can't toast on a thread that has not called Looper.prepare()" crash
- `$5.smali`: fixed trailing `;` on primitive `iput`/`iget` type descriptor (smali parse error)

### What changed
- "↓ Download from Nightlies" entry added to Component Manager type-selection menu (Add New Component flow)
- Tapping it opens ComponentDownloadActivity: fetches GitHub Releases API, lists latest nightly .wcp/.zip/.xz assets
- Tap any asset → downloads to cacheDir → calls ComponentInjectorHelper.injectComponent → toast result + finish
- Type auto-detected from filename: box64→94, fex→95, vkd3d→13, turnip/adreno/driver→10, default=dxvk→12

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — showTypeSelection (6→7 items), onItemClick mode=2 (position 0 launches downloader)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` (new)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$1.smali` (new — FetchRunnable)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$2.smali` (new — ShowListRunnable)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$3.smali` (new — DownloadRunnable)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$4.smali` (new — CompleteRunnable)
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml` — registered ComponentDownloadActivity

## [stable] — v2.3.0 — Stable release (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `cdb1f06`  |  **Tag:** v2.3.0  |  **CI run:** `23118528237` (~22min ✓)

### What changed (new since v2.2.4)
- True component injection into GameHub menus (Add New Component flow)
- FEXCore resilience on missing/corrupt profile.json
- ZIP injection: folder name + libraryName fixes
- Remove option in Component Manager
- RTS gesture dialog shrunk ~20%, close button fixed (nav bar overlap)
- EmuReady API toggle defaults to off
- 7th APK variant: Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-Original.apk (com.xiaoji.egggame)
- README rewritten with full feature set and 7-variant install table

### Files touched
- All patches from v2.2.5-pre through v2.2.11-pre
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` (7th variant)
- `README.md`

---

## [pre] — v2.2.11-pre — Default EmuReady API toggle to off (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `bc457d8`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.11-pre  |  **CI run:** `67140309487` (3m42s ✓)

### What changed
- `GameHubPrefs.isExternalAPI()` called `getBoolean("use_external_api", true)` — default was `true`
- Changed default to `false` (`0x1` → `0x0`) so the EmuReady API toggle is off on fresh installs
- Users who already have a saved value in SharedPrefs are unaffected

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes6/app/revanced/extension/gamehub/prefs/GameHubPrefs.smali` (new)

---

## [pre] — v2.2.10-pre — Fix Close button unreachable behind nav bar (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `626c9d0`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.10-pre  |  **CI run:** `23115230824` (3m45s ✓)

### What changed
- Added `android:paddingBottom="56dp"` to the root `FrameLayout` in `rts_gesture_config_dialog.xml`
- Root cause: GameHub runs in immersive mode (window extends behind nav bar); `layout_gravity="center"` was centering the dialog in the full window area, placing the Close button behind the navigation bar where touches are intercepted by the system
- Fix ensures the dialog centers within the usable screen area, keeping the Close button tappable

### Files touched
- `patches/res/layout/rts_gesture_config_dialog.xml`

---

## [pre] — v2.2.9-pre — Shrink RTS gesture settings dialog ~20% (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `bb3d420`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.9-pre  |  **CI run:** `23114552262` (3m41s ✓)

### What changed
- All 6 gesture rows: 48dp → 38dp height
- Close button: 44dp → 35dp height
- Top margins and bottom padding trimmed proportionally (14→11dp, 16→12dp)
- Fixes navigation bar and status bar overlapping the dialog and blocking buttons

### Files touched
- `patches/res/layout/rts_gesture_config_dialog.xml`

---

## [pre] — v2.2.8-pre — Add Remove option to Component Manager (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `5b39138`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.8-pre  |  **CI run:** `23114139058` (3m41s ✓)

### What changed
- Added "Remove" to the per-component options menu (between Backup and Back)
- Tapping Remove unregisters the component from `EmuComponents` in-memory HashMap, recursively deletes its folder from `components/`, shows "Removed: <name>" toast, returns to list
- New `removeComponent()V` method and `deleteDir(File)V` static recursive helper

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

---

## [pre] — v2.2.7-pre — ZIP injection fixes: name/dir mismatch + libraryName rename (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `fd5e176`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.7-pre  |  **CI:** ✅

### What changed
- ZIP name/dir mismatch fixed: folder name is always the ZIP filename, `meta.json["name"]` no longer overwrites it
- Wrong `.so` name fixed: reads `meta.json["libraryName"]` after extraction and renames to `libvulkan_freedreno.so` if different
- Title TextView and system bar padding confirmed working

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentInjectorHelper.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

## [pre] — v2.2.6-pre — Component menu visibility + FEXCore resilience (2026-03-15)
**Commit:** `00a324a`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.6-pre  |  **CI run:** `23102478881` (3m37s ✓)

### What changed
- **ComponentInjectorHelper — FEXCore fallback**: When `readWcpProfile` returns null
  (XZ decompression fails or no `profile.json`), injection no longer aborts. Instead
  falls back to filename-derived name and continues to folder creation + extraction.
- **ComponentInjectorHelper — state fix**: `registerComponent` now uses
  `LState;->Extracted:LState;` instead of `LState;->INSTALLED:LState;`. This makes
  `EmuComponents.isComponentNeed2Download()` return false immediately so GameHub won't
  try to re-download the component from an empty URL.
- **ComponentInjectorHelper — appendLocalComponents**: New static method
  `appendLocalComponents(List<DialogSettingListItemEntity>, int contentType)` that
  iterates the EmuComponents HashMap and appends locally installed components matching
  the queried content type. `TRANSLATOR(32)` also matches `BOX64(94)` and `FEXCORE(95)`.
- **GameSettingViewModel$fetchList$1 — inject call**: Two lines added just before the
  server callback is invoked — reads `$contentType` from the coroutine state, calls
  `appendLocalComponents(v7, contentType)`. Injected DXVK/VKD3D/GPU/Box64/FEXCore
  components now appear alongside server results in every selection dialog.

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentInjectorHelper.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes3/com/xj/winemu/settings/GameSettingViewModel$fetchList$1.smali` (new)

## [pre] — v2.2.5-pre — True component injection into GameHub menus (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `e7dd944`  |  **Tag:** v2.2.5-pre

### What changed
- **ComponentManagerActivity**: prepended "+ Add New Component" at index 0 of the
  component list. Added `selectedType:I` field. New mode=2 type-selection screen shows
  DXVK / VKD3D-Proton / Box64 / FEXCore / GPU Driver Turnip / ← Back. mode=3 launches
  file picker for the new inject flow. `onActivityResult` branches mode=3 →
  ComponentInjectorHelper (new inject), mode=1 → existing replace flow unchanged.
- **ComponentInjectorHelper** (new file): static helper class. Detects WCP (Zstd
  magic 0x28 / XZ magic 0xFD) or ZIP (0x50) from first byte. For WCP: reads
  `profile.json` in a first pass to get `versionName`; creates a new folder under
  `components/` named after versionName; extracts files (FEXCore: flat extraction;
  all others: preserve `system32/`/`syswow64/` structure). For ZIP: flat extraction +
  parses `meta.json` for name/description. Constructs `EnvLayerEntity` + `ComponentRepo`
  with `state=INSTALLED` and registers via `EmuComponents.D()` so the component
  appears in GameHub's in-app selection menus immediately — no existing component replaced.

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentInjectorHelper.smali` (new)

### What changed
- Promoted v2.2.4-pre to stable.
- Added 6th APK variant: `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-alt-AnTuTu.apk` (`com.antutu.benchmark.full`)
- Release description covers new since v2.2.3 + full feature set + installation table (6 APKs).
- README updated: alt-AnTuTu row added to install table, Offline Steam Launch section added.

### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `README.md`
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md`

## ci — add quick build workflow for pre/beta tags (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `4e0e510` | **Tag:** none

### What changed
- Added `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml`: triggers on `v*-pre*` and `v*-beta*` tags;
  builds only the Normal (gamehub.lite) APK — 1 build instead of 5.
- Updated `build.yml` to exclude `v*-pre*` and `v*-beta*` tags so both workflows
  don't run simultaneously on pre/beta pushes. Stable `v*` tags still build all 5 APKs.

### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build-quick.yml` (new)
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` (tag filter updated)

## v2.2.4-pre — feat: skip Steam login screen when offline at cold start (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `b16848f` | **Tag:** `v2.2.4-pre`

### What changed
- Patched `SteamGameByPcEmuLaunchStrategy$execute$3.smali` to skip the Steam login
  screen when there is no network connection at cold start.
- When autoLogin fails AND network is unavailable (`NetworkUtils.r()` == false),
  the login screen is bypassed and the game launch pipeline proceeds with cached config.
- When autoLogin fails AND network IS available, login screen shown as normal.
- Developed on `beta` branch as `v2.2.4-beta1`, confirmed working, merged to main.

### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes10/com/xj/landscape/launcher/launcher/strategy/SteamGameByPcEmuLaunchStrategy$execute$3.smali` (new)

## v2.2.3 — stable release (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `580fb60` | **Tag:** `v2.2.3`

### What changed
- Promoted v2.2.3-pre to stable.
- Release description covers new fixes since v2.2.2 + full feature set + installation table.

---

## v2.2.3-pre — fix: RTS gesture settings dialog crash + cog icon (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `580fb60` | **Tag:** `v2.2.3-pre`

### What changed
- `rts_gesture_config_dialog.xml`: replaced all 3 `com.hjq.shape.view.ShapeTextView` elements
  with plain `TextView` using `android:background` inline colors.
  ShapeTextView is from the HJQ library, which is not in GameHub 5.3.5 — caused
  `ClassNotFoundException` at inflate time → app crash on every cog tap.
  Spinners (`rts_gesture_pinch_spinner`, `rts_gesture_two_finger_spinner`): `android:background="#1affffff"`.
  Close button (`tvClose`): `android:background="#ff3b82f6"`.
- `winemu_sidebar_controls_fragment.xml`: replaced `@drawable/ic_settings` with
  `@drawable/winemu_ic_setting_focus_white` so the gear button is visibly white on the dark sidebar.

### Files touched
- `patches/res/layout/rts_gesture_config_dialog.xml`
- `patches/res/layout/winemu_sidebar_controls_fragment.xml`

---

## v2.2.2 — feat: per-variant display labels + full release notes (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `8f435ce` (code), `cc06d32` (docs) | **Tag:** `v2.2.2`

### What changed
- Each APK variant now sets its own `android:label` in AndroidManifest before rebuild
  - Normal → "GameHub Revanced", PuBG → "GameHub Revanced PuBG", AnTuTu → "GameHub Revanced AnTuTu", Ludashi → "GameHub Revanced Ludashi", Genshin → "GameHub Revanced Genshin"
- Release description updated with full app feature set + credits to @Nightwalker743 for RTS controls
- README updated: credit link, display name column in install table, asterisk note on configurable gestures

### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `README.md`
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md`

---

## v2.2.1 — feat: RTS touch controls (2026-03-14)
**Commit:** `b1a0945` | **Tag:** `v2.2.1`

### What changed
- Ported RTS touch controls from gamehub-lite PR #73 (Nightwalker743) to bannerhub's 5.3.5 ReVanced base
- All smali class numbers corrected (5.1.0 classes4/5 → 5.3.5 classes9/14/15/16)
- Obfuscated method names hand-mapped for 5.3.5 throughout
- `shape_radius`/`shape_solidColor` XML attributes renamed to `xj_shape_radius`/`xj_shape_solidColor` for 5.3.5 compat
- Added `CloudProgressStyle` stub to satisfy aapt2 strict link validation triggered by new layout files
- Removed WinUIBridge.smali replacement to avoid classes9.dex 65535 reference overflow
- New files placed in smali_classes16 (free slot)

### Features added
- Tap to click, drag for box selection, long press right-click, double-tap double-click
- Two-finger pan for camera, pinch-to-zoom (mouse wheel)

## Session 6 — 2026-03-13

### [planned] — Backlog / Upcoming Work
Items identified from code review — prioritized by impact:

#### 1. Confirm before inject ⚠️ (high priority — data safety)
- `injectFile()` wipes the entire component folder before extracting — no warning given
- Add an `AlertDialog` on "Inject file..." tap: "Replace contents of [component]? This cannot be undone."
- Only proceed to `pickFile()` if user confirms

#### 2. Back + Exit buttons (pending from previous session)
- Add a horizontal button row below the title header, above the ListView
- **Back** — navigates up one level (options → components) or closes the activity if already at root
- **Exit** — always calls `finish()` to close the activity immediately
- Buttons should be outside the list, not list items

#### 3. "Injecting..." progress toast at thread start
- Currently no visual feedback between file pick and success/fail toast
- Post a "Injecting, please wait..." toast to the UI thread at the top of `$1.run()` before calling `WcpExtractor.extract()`
- Prevents users from thinking the app froze on large WCP files

#### 4. Sort components alphabetically
- `listFiles()` returns folders in filesystem order (non-deterministic)
- Add `Arrays.sort()` on the components `File[]` before building the display name array
- One-line change in `showComponents()`

#### 5. Clear label option in options menu
- No way to remove a `[-> filename]` SharedPreferences label once set
- Add a 4th item "Clear label" to `showOptions()` that removes the key from `bh_injected` SharedPreferences
- Handle `pswitch_3` in `onItemClick()` packed-switch

#### 6. Component count in title
- Update the title `TextView` text after components are loaded: "Banners Component Injector (N)"
- Requires storing a reference to the title `TextView` as an activity field so `showComponents()` can update it

---

## Session 5 — 2026-03-12

### [stable] — v2.2.0 — Stable release: Multi-APK Builds & AOSP Testkeys (2026-03-12)
**Tag:** `v2.2.0`
#### What changed
- Promoted v2.1.2-pre fixes to stable.
- Build workflow updated to sign all APKs using standard AOSP `testkey` (v1, v2, and v3 signatures enabled) instead of the local debug keystore.
- Build workflow now automatically builds 5 separate APKs per run, each with a unique package name injected into its `AndroidManifest.xml` and `android:authorities` to prevent conflicts.
- Available APKs/Packages:
  - `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-Normal.apk` (`gamehub.lite`)
  - `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-PuBG.apk` (`com.tencent.ig`)
  - `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-AnTuTu.apk` (`com.antutu.ABenchMark`)
  - `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-Ludashi.apk` (`com.ludashi.aibench`)
  - `Bannerhub-5.3.5-Revanced-Genshin.apk` (`com.mihoyo.genshinimpact`)
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `testkey.pk8`, `testkey.x509.pem` (added)

---

## Session 4 — 2026-03-12

### [patch] — v2.1.2-pre — Show last injected filename per component (2026-03-12)
**Commit:** `cc31765` (fix) / `0070548` (initial, failed build) | **Tag:** v2.1.2-pre ✅
#### What changed
- After a successful inject, the component list row shows `"ComponentName [-> filename.wcp]"`
- Label persists across app restarts via SharedPreferences (`"bh_injected"` prefs file, keyed by component folder name)
- Updates each time a new file is injected into that component
#### Implementation
- New `getFileName(Uri)String` method on activity — queries `_display_name` via `ContentResolver` using `invoke-virtual/range` for the 6-register query call
- `$1.run()` calls `this$0.getFileName(val$uri)` on extract success, then saves `componentDir.getName() → filename` to SharedPreferences before posting the success runnable
- `showComponents()` reads SharedPreferences before the name loop; builds `"name [-> filename]"` string with StringBuilder if key is present, plain name otherwise. `.locals 9` → `.locals 11`
#### Build notes
- First attempt (`0070548`) failed: `invoke-direct {v1, p0, p1, v0, v2, v4}` — 6 registers exceeds invoke-direct max of 5. Fixed by keeping $1 constructor at 4 args and calling `getFileName()` from inside `$1.run()` instead.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity$1.smali`

**Commit:** `6b9195d` | **Tag:** v2.1.1 (current stable)
#### What changed
- v2.1.2 patch (inject label display) reverted — hard reset to `6b9195d`
- v2.1.2 GitHub release deleted, remote and local tag removed
- Repo back to v2.1.1 as latest

---

### [patch] — Add "Banners Component Injector" title header to all Component Manager menus
**Commit:** `6b9195d` | **Tag:** v2.1.1 ✅
#### What changed
- Users were having trouble tapping top list items in the Component Manager — the list started at the very top of the screen
- Wrapped the raw `ListView` content view in a vertical `LinearLayout`
- Added a `TextView` at the top: text "Banners Component Injector", 20sp, centered, 48px padding all sides
- `ListView` given `LinearLayout.LayoutParams(MATCH_PARENT, 0dp, weight=1)` so it fills remaining space
- Title persists across both the components list view and the options menu (Inject / Backup / Back) — no changes needed to `showComponents()` or `showOptions()`
- `onCreate` `.locals` bumped from 2 to 6 for the new registers
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

#### What changed
- Promoted v2.0.6-pre fixes to stable
- All three injection paths now work: ZIP (Turnip/adrenotools), zstd WCP (DXVK/VKD3D/Box64/FEXCore), XZ WCP (FEXCore nightlies)
- README rewritten to accurately describe all features, installation, and architecture
#### Files touched
- `README.md`

---

## Session 1 — 2026-03-12

### [init] — Initial repo setup
**Commit:** `78c525c` | **Tag:** none
#### What changed
- Created GitHub repo `The412Banner/bannerhub`
- Built apktool-based rebuild workflow: downloads base APK → decompile → overlay `patches/` → rebuild → sign → release
- Generated debug keystore (`keystore.jks`, alias: `bannerhub`, pw: `bannerhub123`)
- Uploaded original `Gamehub-5.3.5-Revanced-Normal.apk` as `base-apk` release asset (136MB)
- `.gitignore` excludes `apktool_out/`, `jadx_out/`, `base/`, rebuilt APKs
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `keystore.jks`
- `patches/.gitkeep`
- `.gitignore`, `README.md`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: apktool permission denied
**Commit:** `0068e4e` | **Tag:** v1.0.1 (failed build)
#### What changed
- apktool jar was being written to `/usr/local/lib/` which is read-only on GitHub runners
- Changed to `$HOME/bin/` for both the jar and wrapper script
- Switched from `apktool` wrapper to `java -jar apktool.jar` calls directly
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: raws.xml aapt2 compile error
**Commit:** `fb55474` | **Tag:** v1.0.2 (failed build)
#### What changed
- `res/values/raws.xml` contains Firebase boolean entries (`firebase_common_keep`, `firebase_crashlytics_keep`) that aapt2 rejects — expects file references, not boolean values
- Added workflow step to `rm -f apktool_out/res/values/raws.xml` after decompile
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

### [fix] — Workflow: dangling public.xml firebase symbols
**Commit:** `415a2b1` | **Tag:** v1.0.3 ✅ **FIRST SUCCESSFUL BUILD**
#### What changed
- Deleting `raws.xml` left `public.xml` declaring those symbols → aapt2 "no definition for declared symbol" error
- Added `sed -i '/firebase_common_keep\|firebase_crashlytics_keep/d' apktool_out/res/values/public.xml` to workflow after the raws.xml deletion
- **Build succeeded** — `Gamehub-rebuilt.apk` produced and uploaded to v1.0.3 release
#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

---

---

### [patch] — Add BCI launcher button to top bar
**Commit:** `b148ee2` | **Tag:** v1.0.4 (failed — firebase regression)
#### What changed
- Added a small "open in new" icon button (`iv_bci_launcher`) to the top-right toolbar, after the search icon
- Tapping it launches BannersComponentInjector (`com.banner.inject`) if installed
- If BCI is not installed, shows a Toast: "BannersComponentInjector is not installed"
- New smali class `BciLauncherClickListener` handles the click logic
- Button wired in `LandscapeLauncherMainActivity.initView()` via `findViewById` + `setOnClickListener`
- New resource ID `iv_bci_launcher` = `0x7f0a0ef9`
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/layout/llauncher_activity_new_launcher_main.xml` — added ImageView
- `patches/res/values/ids.xml` — added `iv_bci_launcher` entry
- `patches/res/values/public.xml` — added public ID `0x7f0a0ef9`
- `patches/smali_classes9/com/xj/landscape/launcher/R$id.smali` — added field
- `patches/smali_classes11/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/main/BciLauncherClickListener.smali` — new file
- `patches/smali_classes11/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/main/LandscapeLauncherMainActivity.smali` — initView hook

### [fix] — patches/public.xml reintroduced firebase symbols
**Commit:** `c30103f` | **Tag:** v1.0.5 (in progress)
#### What changed
- The `patches/res/values/public.xml` overlay was overwriting the workflow-cleaned version, putting firebase entries back
- Removed `firebase_common_keep` and `firebase_crashlytics_keep` lines from `patches/public.xml`
- **Rule going forward:** Any patch that includes `public.xml` or touches resource files must also not contain the two firebase raw entries
#### Files touched
- `patches/res/values/public.xml`

---

## Known Issues / Notes

- **firebase raws rule:** Never include `firebase_common_keep` or `firebase_crashlytics_keep` entries in any patched `public.xml` — they have no corresponding raw file and aapt2 will reject the build
- **Signing:** Debug key only (`keystore.jks`). Must uninstall existing GameHub before sideloading rebuilt APK (signature mismatch)
- **Base APK:** `Gamehub-5.3.5-Revanced-Normal.apk` stored in `base-apk` release — do not delete
- **apktool version:** 2.9.3 (pinned in workflow)
- **DataBinding note:** The main launcher uses DataBinding. New views added via layout XML patches can be wired via `getMDataBind().getRoot().findViewById()` in `initView` without touching the binding impl classes

### [release] — v1.0.5 marked as stable release
**Commit:** `dad069f` | **Tag:** v1.0.5 ✅ **STABLE**
#### What changed
- v1.0.5 build succeeded and promoted to stable release
- Release description written covering all applied patches: "My Games" tab rename + BCI launcher button
- Progress log added to repo

---

### [patch] — Option B: Embedded Component Manager in side menu
**Commit:** `d2f17e9` | **Tag:** v1.0.6 (failed — dex index overflow)
#### What changed
- Added "Components" item (ID=9) to `HomeLeftMenuDialog` side nav menu
- Extended packed-switch table in `HomeLeftMenuDialog.o1()` to handle ID 9 → launches `ComponentManagerActivity`
- New `ComponentManagerActivity` (pure smali, no Kotlin compile needed):
  - Extends `AppCompatActivity`, implements `AdapterView$OnItemClickListener`
  - Lists GameHub component folders from `getFilesDir()/usr/home/components/` in a ListView
  - Per-component options: Inject file (SAF `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`), Backup to `Downloads/BannerHub/{name}/`
  - Backup uses recursive `copyDir()` — no root required
  - Back press from options list returns to component list
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: declared `ComponentManagerActivity` with `sensorLandscape` orientation
#### Build failure
- Adding ComponentManagerActivity to smali_classes11 pushed the dex string/type index over the 65535 unsigned short limit → `DexIndexOverflowException` during apktool rebuild
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes5/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/HomeLeftMenuDialog.smali` — MenuItem add + pswitch_9 + table extension
- `patches/smali_classes11/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — new file (later moved)
- `patches/AndroidManifest.xml` — activity declaration

---

### [fix] — Move ComponentManagerActivity to smali_classes16
**Commit:** (part of v1.0.7 push) | **Tag:** v1.0.7 ✅
#### What changed
- smali_classes11 was near the 65535 dex index limit; ComponentManagerActivity pushed it over
- smali_classes16 only has ~100 classes — plenty of headroom
- Moved `ComponentManagerActivity.smali` to `patches/smali_classes16/` directory
- **Build succeeded** — Components item visible in side menu, activity launches
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — moved from classes11

---

### [fix] — VerifyError crashes on launch
**Commit:** (part of v1.0.8 push) | **Tag:** v1.0.8 ✅
#### What changed
- `backupComponent()` called `invoke-static {}` with no arguments on `getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(String)` — fixed to use `sget-object Landroid/os/Environment;->DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS:Ljava/lang/String;` then `invoke-static {v}`
- `copyDir()` had `new-array v8, v8, [B` before v8 was initialized (duplicate line) — removed
- ART's verifier rejects methods with uninitialized register use → `VerifyError` at class load time, crashing the app before the activity even appears
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

---

### [fix] — ArrayAdapter crash on component list display
**Commit:** (part of v1.0.9 push) | **Tag:** v1.0.9 ✅
#### What changed
- Hardcoded layout resource ID `0x01090001` was passed to `ArrayAdapter` constructor — on this Android version it resolved to an `ExpandableListView` layout, not a simple text item → crash
- Fixed to use `sget Landroid/R$layout;->simple_list_item_1:I` to resolve the ID at runtime from the Android framework
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

---

### [fix] — invoke-virtual 6-register overflow
**Commit:** (part of v1.0.10 push) | **Tag:** v1.0.10 ✅
#### What changed
- `ContentResolver.query()` takes 5 parameters (+ instance = 6 registers total) — `invoke-virtual` max is 5 registers; 6+ requires `invoke-virtual/range`
- Rewrote the `_display_name` query in `getFileName()` to use `invoke-virtual/range {v3 .. v8}` with consecutive registers (moved `p1` ContentResolver into `v4` first)
- This was needed to read the human-readable filename from a SAF content:// URI
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

---

### [fix] — "Inject failed" with path string as error message
**Commit:** (part of v1.0.11 push) | **Tag:** v1.0.11 ✅
#### What changed
- `getLastPathSegment()` on a SAF `content://` document URI returns `primary:Download/file.wcp` (the path segment from the tree URI), not the filename
- Replaced with `ContentResolver.query()` using `OpenableColumns._DISPLAY_NAME` to get the actual filename
- Raw file copy injection now correctly names the destination file
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali`

---

### [release] — v2.0.0 stable: working component manager
**Commit:** (stable tag) | **Tag:** v2.0.0 ✅ **STABLE**
#### What changed
- Promoted to stable after verifying: component list displays, backup works, raw file inject works
- Release description covers all features: "My Games" tab, BCI launcher button, Components side menu (list, backup, inject)
- All prior pre-release tags left intact

---

### [patch] — WCP/ZIP proper extraction pipeline (attempt 1: baksmali)
**Commit:** (v2.0.1-pre) | **Tag:** v2.0.1-pre (failed build)
#### What changed
- Plan: decompile library JARs to smali with baksmali, merge into patches, rebuild with apktool
- `baksmali` download via GitHub releases URL returned 404 (no assets on google/smali releases)
#### Build failure
- `wget` 404 on baksmali JAR URL

---

### [patch] — WCP/ZIP extraction pipeline (attempt 2: Maven baksmali)
**Commit:** (v2.0.2-pre) | **Tag:** v2.0.2-pre (failed build)
#### What changed
- Tried `org.smali:baksmali:2.5.2` from Maven Central — the Maven artifact is a library-only JAR with no `Main-Class` manifest entry
- Abandoned baksmali entirely
- **New approach:** download commons-compress, aircompressor, xz JARs and convert directly to dex via Android SDK `d8` tool, then inject dex files into the rebuilt APK using `zip`
#### Build failure
- `java -jar baksmali.jar` → "no main manifest attribute"

---

### [patch] — WCP/ZIP extraction pipeline (attempt 3: d8 dex injection) + WcpExtractor
**Commit:** (v2.0.3-pre) | **Tag:** v2.0.3-pre ✅ build succeeded, runtime crash
#### What changed
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: added two new steps:
  1. **"Convert extraction libraries to dex"**: downloads `commons-compress-1.26.2.jar`, `aircompressor-0.27.jar`, `xz-1.9.jar` from Maven Central; converts all three to dex via `d8 --release --min-api 29 --output lib_dex/`
  2. **"Inject library dex files into APK"**: zips `lib_dex/classes*.dex` into rebuilt APK as `classes18.dex`, `classes19.dex`, etc. (apktool already packed classes1-17)
- `WcpExtractor.smali` (new): detects file format by magic bytes, routes to extractZip() or extractTar()
  - ZIP (magic `50 4B 03 04`) → `java.util.zip.ZipInputStream`, flat extraction (basename only)
  - zstd tar (magic `28 B5 2F FD`) → `io.airlift.compress.zstd.ZstdInputStream` + `TarArchiveInputStream`
  - XZ tar (magic `FD 37 7A 58`) → `org.tukaani.xz.XZInputStream` + `TarArchiveInputStream`
  - Reads `profile.json` from tar to detect FEXCore type → `flattenToRoot=true`; all others preserve system32/syswow64 structure
- `ComponentManagerActivity.injectFile()`: replaced raw file copy with `WcpExtractor.extract(cr, uri, componentDir)`
#### Runtime crash
- FATAL EXCEPTION in `WcpExtractor.extract()` not caught by `catch Ljava/lang/Exception;` in `injectFile()` — `Error` subclasses (`NoClassDefFoundError`, `OutOfMemoryError`) are not `Exception` subclasses, they bypass the catch block and crash the app

---

### [fix] — Background thread + Throwable catch for WCP extraction
**Commit:** `7ad71f4` | **Tag:** v2.0.4-pre ✅
#### What changed
- `injectFile()` now spawns a `java.lang.Thread` — extraction runs off the main thread (fixes long black screen while processing large WCP files)
- `ComponentManagerActivity$1.smali` (new): background Runnable
  - Calls `WcpExtractor.extract()`, catches `Throwable` (catches all Error subclasses, not just Exception)
  - Posts result to main thread via `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())`
- `ComponentManagerActivity$2.smali` (new): UI Runnable
  - null result → shows "Injected successfully" toast + refreshes list
  - non-null result → shows "Inject failed: <message>" toast + refreshes list
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — injectFile() rewritten
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity$1.smali` — new
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity$2.smali` — new

---

### [fix] — XZ constructor NoSuchMethodError + clear before inject
**Commit:** `fb5592d` | **Tag:** v2.0.5-pre ✅
#### What changed
- **XZ fix:** `org.tukaani.xz.XZInputStream` constructor `<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;)V` was not found at runtime after d8 conversion of xz-1.9.jar (`NoSuchMethodError: No direct method <init>(InputStream)V in class Lorg/tukaani/xz/XZInputStream`). Root cause: d8 processes the xz JAR in a way that makes the constructor unreachable under ART's direct-method lookup. Fix: replaced with `org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.xz.XZCompressorInputStream` (from commons-compress, which wraps tukaani internally and has a working constructor in the d8-compiled dex)
- **Clear before inject:** added `clearDir(File)` static method to WcpExtractor — recursively deletes all files and subdirs inside destDir before extraction. Called at start of `extract()`. Fixes stale files being left from previous inject (e.g. old system32/ contents when replacing a WCP component)
- ZIP injection confirmed working. WCP (XZ) confirmed error is now surfaced as a toast (Throwable catch from v2.0.4-pre). ZstdInputStream (aircompressor) not yet confirmed — needs test with DXVK/VKD3D WCP.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/WcpExtractor.smali`

---

### [fix] — Use GameHub's own built-in classes, remove d8 injection entirely
**Commit:** `b52055c` | **Tag:** v2.0.6-pre
#### Root cause discovered
GameHub's APK already contains `commons-compress`, `zstd-jni` (`libzstd-jni-1.5.7-4.so`), and `org.tukaani.xz` as part of its normal dependencies. However, `commons-compress` is fully obfuscated by ProGuard — `TarArchiveInputStream.getNextTarEntry()` renamed to `s()`, `isDirectory()` renamed to unknown single-letter. When we injected d8-converted JARs (classes18+), Android's class loader used GameHub's obfuscated copy first (earlier dex wins), so `getNextTarEntry()` was not found. For aircompressor: `sun.misc.Unsafe.ARRAY_BYTE_BASE_OFFSET` does not exist as a static field on Android ART.
#### What changed
- **`WcpExtractor.smali`**: Rewritten to use GameHub's built-in classes with their actual runtime signatures:
  - ZIP: `java.util.zip.ZipInputStream`, flat extraction (basename only) — unchanged
  - zstd tar: `Lcom/github/luben/zstd/ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer;` (JNI class, NOT obfuscated) → `<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;)V`
  - XZ tar: `Lorg/tukaani/xz/XZInputStream;` (NOT obfuscated) → `<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;I)V` (-1 = unlimited)
  - Tar: `TarArchiveInputStream.<init>(InputStream)V` + `s()` for `getNextTarEntry()` (obfuscated name, confirmed via bridge)
  - Directory detection: `getName().endsWith("/")` — `getName()` is kept (ArchiveEntry interface); `isDirectory()` is not
  - Format detection: `BufferedInputStream.mark(4)/reset()` — single open, no double open
- **`build.yml`**: Removed "Convert libraries to dex" + "Inject dex into APK" steps — GameHub already has everything needed
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/WcpExtractor.smali`
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`

### [feat] — CPU core dialog: 2×4 grid (TableLayout, row 0=Eff, row 1=Perf/Prime) — v2.4.2-beta9 (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `158d98c`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta9  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper.smali`**: Replaced `setMultiChoiceItems` (vertical list) with `setView(tableLayout)`. TableLayout has 2 TableRows of 4 CheckBoxes. `setStretchAllColumns(true)` for equal column widths. Each CheckBox inits from `checked[]` and gets a `$4` listener.
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper$4.smali`** (new): `CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener` capturing `(boolean[], int)`. `onCheckedChanged` stores the new boolean into `a[b]` — keeps `checked[]` in sync for `$2` Apply to read.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper$4.smali` (new)

### [feat] — CPU core dialog: warn if no cores selected on Apply — v2.4.2-beta8c (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `23e8470`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta8c  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`**: If all checkboxes are unchecked when Apply is tapped, shows Toast "Select at least one core" and returns without saving. Uses `move-object/from16 v4, p1` to get the dialog's Context (p1=v34 with `.locals 33`, out of 4-bit range for regular `move-object`).
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`

---

### [fix] — CPU core dialog: half-width, 90% height, all-cores = No Limit — v2.4.2-beta7 (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `3fab423`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta7  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23353066650
#### What changed
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper.smali`**: `Window.setLayout()` now uses `widthPixels / 2` (half-wide) and `heightPixels * 9/10` (90% tall). Was `WRAP_CONTENT` wide and 80% tall.
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`**: After bitmask fold, if all 8 cores are checked (mask=0xFF), saves 0 (No Limit) instead of 0xFF. Semantically identical behavior to the "No Limit" button.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`

### [fix] — Fix IllegalAccessError: use Kotlin defaults ctor + move-object/from16 — v2.4.2-beta6b (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `e8e41a8`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.2-beta6b  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`**: Replaced `iput id/isSelected` with full Kotlin defaults constructor (`invoke-direct/range {v7..v32}`, bitmask `0x3ffffa`). Added `move-object/from16 v3, p0` — required because `.locals 33` pushes `p0` to `v33` (out of 4-bit range for `iget-object`).
- **`CpuMultiSelectHelper$3.smali`**: Same fix, `move-object/from16 v6, p0`, `id=0` for No Limit.
#### Root cause
ART 14 blocks cross-dex private field access. `DialogSettingListItemEntity` is in classes12 (bypassed dex); our code is in classes16. Direct `iput` on private backing fields threw `IllegalAccessError`. Fix: use the public Kotlin defaults constructor.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper$2.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/settings/CpuMultiSelectHelper$3.smali`

### [stable] — v2.4.3 — Per-game CPU core affinity + VRAM unlock + offline fixes (2026-03-17)
**Commit:** `77d3a9a`  |  **Tag:** v2.4.3  |  **CI:** ✅ build.yml — 8 APKs
#### What's new since v2.4.0
- Per-game CPU Core Affinity multi-select dialog (setMultiChoiceItems, Html small labels, half-width, 90% height)
  - Apply saves bitmask; No Limit saves 0; Cancel discards
  - All cores checked = No Limit; no cores = Toast warning
  - Immediate UI refresh via Kotlin defaults constructor
- VRAM unlock: 6/8/12/16 GB options with display text + checkmark fix
- Offline PC game settings: catches NoCacheException, loads from cache
#### All beta tags deleted after stable build (v2.4.2-beta1 through beta12)

### [pre] — v2.4.4-pre — Sustained Performance Mode toggle (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** TBD  |  **Tag:** v2.4.4-pre  |  **Branch:** main
**What changed:** Added ⚡ Sustained Perf: ON/OFF toggle as first item in ComponentManagerActivity list. Tapping toggles `sustained_perf` in `bh_prefs` SharedPreferences and shows a toast. WineActivity.onCreate() reads the flag (after :cond_perf_1) and calls `window.setSustainedPerformanceMode(true)` if enabled.
**Files touched:** `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali`, `patches/smali_classes15/.../WineActivity.smali`, `COMPONENT_MANAGER_BUILD_LOG.md`, `PROGRESS_LOG.md`

### v2.4.6-pre — 2026-03-18
**Commit:** `60cafd9` | **CI:** ✅
- Moved Sustained Performance Mode toggle from Components menu to in-game sidebar (Controls tab)
- Takes effect immediately while in-game; saves to bh_prefs/sustained_perf
- ComponentManagerActivity list offsets corrected (Add New = pos 0, dirs = 1+, Remove All = last)

### v2.4.7-pre — 2026-03-18
**Commit:** `2ab8f7a` | **CI:** ✅
- Moved Sustained Performance + added Max Adreno Clocks to Performance sidebar tab
- Max Adreno Clocks: root-only, locks kgsl-3d0 min_freq = max_freq; persists across launches
- Used BhPerfSetupDelegate (smali_classes16 view) to avoid classes9 dex limit

### [fix] — v2.5.4-pre — VerifyError crash + perf toggles activate after root grant (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `5182488` | **Tag:** v2.5.4-pre | **CI:** ✅ run 23342648406 — PASSED
#### What changed
- **`BhRootGrantHelper$2$1$1.smali`**: `iput` → `iput-boolean` for boolean field `b:Z` in constructor.
  ART's verifier rejected the class at load time — VerifyError crashed the app on the grant thread.
- **`BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`**: Added `onVisibilityChanged(View, int)`. Fires every time the
  Performance sidebar tab becomes visible. Re-reads `root_granted` from bh_prefs and either:
  - Grants: restores alpha to 1.0f, wires SustainedPerfSwitchClickListener + MaxAdrenoClickListener
  - Denied: greys out at 0.5f, no listeners set
  Previously `onAttachedToWindow()` ran only once — root granted later never updated the UI.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhRootGrantHelper$2$1$1.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`

### [stable] — v2.6.1 — Fix perf toggle visual state persistence (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `c8ebfdc` | **Tag:** v2.6.1 | **CI:** ✅
- Promotes v2.6.1-pre to stable
- Fix: Sustained Perf + Max Adreno Clocks toggles now persist visual state across sidebar open/close
- Pref save moved into click listeners so SharedPreferences is always accessible
- Credits section added to README; repo links for Arihany and Nightlies sources added

### [fix] — v2.6.1-pre — Fix perf toggles not persisting visual state (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `4fd439d` | **Tag:** v2.6.1-pre | **CI:** ✅ run 23353066650
- Performance toggles (Sustained Perf, Max Adreno Clocks) showed as OFF when Performance sidebar was reopened, even though the system effects were actually applied
- Root cause: WineActivity.toggleSustainedPerf/toggleMaxAdreno only saved bh_prefs when WineActivity.t1 was non-null; t1 is set in i2(Z)V which isn't guaranteed to have run when the toggle fires
- Fix: moved pref saving into SustainedPerfSwitchClickListener and MaxAdrenoClickListener — both have a View with context, so getSharedPreferences always works
- WineActivity.toggleSustainedPerf now only calls setSustainedPerformanceMode (still needs Window from t1); toggleMaxAdreno goes straight to su root command
- **Logcat verified:** `logcat-2026-03-20_12-58-55.txt` — no errors from v2.6.1-pre; fix confirmed working by user

### [pre] — v2.6.7-pre — Fix buildUI() VerifyError: .locals 5 p0=v5 collision (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `18268e5`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.7-pre
#### What changed
- buildUI() crashed with VerifyError at offset [0x32]: "tried to get class from non-reference register v5 (type=IntegerConstant)"
- Root cause: `.locals 5` made p0 (this) map to v5. `const/high16 v5, 0x3f800000` (1.0f for LayoutParams weight) overwrote p0/v5 with an integer constant, corrupting the `this` reference for all subsequent p0 uses
- Fix: `.locals 5` → `.locals 6` in buildUI(); p0 now maps to v6 (never written), v5 is a proper local register
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — `.locals 5` → `.locals 6` in buildUI()
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` — this entry

### [pre] — v2.6.8-pre — Fix IllegalAccessError: private fields inaccessible to inner classes (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `5258d1c`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.8-pre
#### What changed
- Inject flow crashed: IllegalAccessError: Field 'ComponentManagerActivity.selectedType' is inaccessible to class 'ComponentManagerActivity$6'
- Root cause: inner classes $4/$5/$6 use iget/iput to access outer-class fields (pendingUri, pendingType, mode, selectedType) which were declared .field private. ART enforces Java access rules — private fields require synthetic accessor methods, not direct iget/iput from inner classes
- Fix: changed all 9 fields from .field private to .field public
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/ComponentManagerActivity.smali` — 9 fields private→public
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` — this entry

### [pre] — v2.6.9-pre — Dark navy UI for ComponentDownloadActivity (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `581eb9a`  |  **Tag:** v2.6.9-pre
#### What changed
- ComponentDownloadActivity (download flow: repo → category → asset) redesigned to match dark navy theme
- Root: 0xFF1A1A2E bg, fitsSystemWindows; header bar 0xFF16213E with ← back btn (orange, onBackPressed) + title (white, weight=1)
- Status text: gray 0xFFAAAAAA, 14sp; ListView: dark bg; items via DarkAdapter (0xFF1E1E35 bg, white text, orange ← Back)
- New: ComponentDownloadActivity$DarkAdapter, ComponentDownloadActivity$BhBackBtn
- Added dp(I)I helper to ComponentDownloadActivity
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity.smali` — new onCreate UI, DarkAdapter swap in showRepos/showCategories/showAssets, dp() added
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentDownloadActivity$DarkAdapter.smali` — new

- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` — this entry

### v2.7.0-pre — Black dark mode UI redesign (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `51fbaf9` | **Tag:** v2.7.0-pre

**What changed:**
- Root/RecyclerView/ListView background: deep black `0xFF0D0D0D` (was dark navy)
- Header/bottom bar background: dark grey `0xFF161616` (was blue-tinted dark)
- Title text ("Component Manager", "Download Components"): orange `0xFFFF9800`
- Status/hint text: darker grey `0xFF888888` (was `0xFFAAAAAA`)
- Item text: off-white `0xFFF0F0F0` (was `0xFFFFFFFF`)
- Removed search bar from ComponentManagerActivity
- Blue + green buttons unified to orange, 48dp → 32dp height, weight → WRAP_CONTENT (left-aligned)
- Buttons have 16dp H / 8dp V padding via makeBtn()
- DarkAdapter item background: StateListDrawable (pressed=`0xFF090909`, D-pad selected=`0xFF241A06`, default=`0xFF1A1A1A`)
- ListView selector: semi-transparent orange `0x40FF9800` for D-pad/controller navigation highlight

### v2.7.1-pre — Buttons to header, D-pad selection fix (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `1a85189` | **Tag:** v2.7.1-pre

**What changed:**
- Removed bottom bar from ComponentManagerActivity entirely
- "+ Add" and "↓ DL" buttons moved into the header bar, right side (before ✕ All)
- makeBtn() padding: 16dp H/8dp V → 8dp H/4dp V (compact for header)
- BhComponentAdapter cards: setFocusable(true) + StateListDrawable foreground (focused=orange overlay 0x60FF9800, pressed=dark overlay, default=transparent) — D-pad navigation now shows clear orange highlight on RecyclerView cards
- DarkAdapter: added state_focused entry, changed selected/focused color from 0xFF241A06 → 0xFF3D2800 (visible amber for D-pad on ListView)

### v2.7.2-pre — Header button shift center-right + card outline dividers (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `6b46084` | **Tag:** v2.7.2-pre | **CI:** ✅ Normal APK built

**What changed:**
- ComponentManagerActivity.buildHeader(): added weight=0.5 flex spacer View between "↓ DL" button and "✕ All" button — shifts "+" and "↓" from hard-right to approx 67% from left (center-right)
- BhComponentAdapter.onCreateViewHolder(): increased .locals 13→14; added GradientDrawable.setStroke(1dp, 0xFF2E2E45) on each card background — very thin rounded outline acting as visual separator between cards

**Files touched:**
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../ComponentManagerActivity.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhComponentAdapter.smali`

### v2.7.3-pre — Fix broken card rendering; 8dp margin card separation (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `faf7704` | **Tag:** v2.7.3-pre | **CI:** ✅ Normal APK built

**Root cause:** setStroke(II)V call in onCreateViewHolder caused a silent exception caught by RecyclerView, resulting in zero items rendered (all 8 cards invisible). `.locals 14` change was also unnecessary.

**What changed:**
- BhComponentAdapter: reverted `.locals 14` → `.locals 13`
- Removed `GradientDrawable.setStroke()` call (caused silent card rendering failure)
- Card margin changed from 12/4/12/4 → 12/8/12/8 dp (8dp top+bottom gives clear visual gap between cards without setStroke)

**Files touched:**
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhComponentAdapter.smali`

### v2.7.4-pre — Rollback to v2.7.0-pre UI state (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `b9e2fc4` | **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre | **CI:** ✅ Normal APK built

**What changed:** Reverted ComponentManagerActivity, BhComponentAdapter, ComponentDownloadActivity$DarkAdapter back to v2.7.0-pre baseline. All v2.7.1/2.7.2/2.7.3 changes removed.

---

### v2.7.5-pre — Buttons to header center-right + card outline border (2026-03-20)
**Commit:** `f6ab3e3` | **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre | **CI:** ✅ Normal APK built

**What changed:**
- buildUI(): bottom bar removed
- buildHeader(): + Add and ↓ DL buttons inserted before ✕ All; weight=0.5 flex spacer between ↓ DL and ✕ All → buttons sit center-right
- makeBtn(): compact padding 16/8dp → 8/4dp (fits in header)
- BhComponentAdapter.onCreateViewHolder: setStroke(1dp, 0xFF3A3A55) using v8 as temp register (v8 is unassigned at that point — no .locals change, no register collision)

---

### v2.7.6-pre — Fix: remove setStroke, 8dp card margins (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `f0d8fe4` | **Tag:** v2.7.6-pre | **CI:** ✅ run 23369306581

**What changed:**
- BhComponentAdapter.onCreateViewHolder: removed the 6-line setStroke block (dp(1) + const color + setStroke call)
- Card margins changed from 12/4/12/4 → 12/8/12/8 dp (v3→v4 for top/bottom)

**Root cause:** Same failure as v2.7.2/v2.7.3: GradientDrawable.setStroke(II)V in onCreateViewHolder is silently caught by RecyclerView in this GameHub version, causing 0 cards rendered. setStroke on a card GradientDrawable inside onCreateViewHolder must not be used here.

### [pre] — v2.7.0-beta36 — GOG game launch: save exe path + Launch button (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** pending  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta36
#### What changed
- `GogDownloadManager$1.smali`: added field `c` (String) to hold temp_executable; in Step 2 extracts `products[0].temp_executable` from build manifest and stores it; in Step 7 after install, saves full exe path to `bh_gog_prefs` as `gog_exe_{gameId}`
- `GogGamesFragment$3.smali`: detail dialog now checks `bh_gog_prefs` for `gog_exe_{gameId}` — shows "Launch" button (GogGamesFragment$7) if installed, "Install" button (GogGamesFragment$6) if not
- `GogGamesFragment$7.smali`: new DialogInterface$OnClickListener; reads stored exe path, normalizes backslashes, builds WineActivityData(gameId, exePath, isLocalGame=true, gameName), starts PcGameSetupActivity with wine_data Parcelable + FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogDownloadManager$1.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogGamesFragment$3.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogGamesFragment$7.smali` (new)

### [pre] — v2.7.0-beta37 — fix: const/16 for v16/v17 in GogGamesFragment$7 (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** `a84fe6a`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta37
#### What changed
- `GogGamesFragment$7.smali`: changed `const/4 v16/v17, 0x0` → `const/16 v16/v17, 0x0`; const/4 only supports v0-v15 (4-bit register field)
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogGamesFragment$7.smali`

### [pre] — v2.7.0-beta38 — GOG: always show Install+Launch buttons; toast when no exe path (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** pending  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta38
#### What changed
- `GogGamesFragment$3.smali`: removed conditional SP check; always shows both Install (setNegativeButton) and Launch (setNeutralButton) — dialog now has [Launch] [Install] [Close]
- `GogGamesFragment$7.smali`: if gog_exe_ SP key empty, shows Toast "Reinstall game to enable launch" instead of silently doing nothing
- `GogDownloadManager$1.smali`: SP write now always runs (no early exit on missing exe); always writes gog_dir_{gameId}=installDir.getName(); only writes gog_exe_{gameId} if temp_executable was in manifest
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogGamesFragment$3.smali`

### [fix] — v2.7.0-beta39 — fix IncompatibleClassChangeError crash on install SP write (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `0abd6bc`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta39
#### What changed
- `GogDownloadManager$1.smali` line 1113: `invoke-virtual` → `invoke-interface` for `SharedPreferences.edit()`
- SharedPreferences is a Java interface; invoke-virtual caused IncompatibleClassChangeError at runtime on every install completion
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogDownloadManager$1.smali`

### [fix] — v2.7.0-beta40 — exe fallback scan when temp_executable absent (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `0c07c55`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta40
#### What changed
- `GogDownloadManager$1.smali`: after depot_loop_done, if field c (temp_executable) is still null, scan all DepotFile JSONObjects for first path ending in `.exe` not containing `redist`; normalize backslashes; store in field c so SP write can record gog_exe_
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogDownloadManager$1.smali`

### [test] — v2.7.0-beta41 — option 1: Z: drive path for Wine exe launch (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `ba7f9dd`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta41
#### What changed
- `GogGamesFragment$7.smali`: convert Android absolute path to Z: drive format before passing to WineActivityData exePath
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../GogGamesFragment$7.smali`

### [feat] — v2.7.0-beta42 — GOG launch: use built-in Import Game flow (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `9362545`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta42
#### What changed
- `GogGamesFragment$7.smali`: replaced WineActivityData + PcGameSetupActivity launch with `LandscapeLauncherMainActivity.B3(exePath)` call, which triggers the built-in `EditImportedGameInfoDialog` (Import Game flow). Uses the full absolute exe path stored in `gog_exe_` SP key.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/GogGamesFragment$7.smali`

### [feat] — v2.7.0-beta43/44 — In-dialog download progress bar (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `030cc9b` (beta43 — CI fail) → `c274659` (beta44 — CI ✅)  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta44
#### What changed
- Install button moved from AlertDialog negative button into content LinearLayout — dialog stays open during download
- `GogDownloadManager$3.smali` (new): UI-thread Runnable updates ProgressBar + status TextView; hides bar at 100%
- `GogDownloadManager$1.smali`: added d/e/f fields (ProgressBar, TextView, Handler); added `postProgress()` helper; replaced 6 progress/completion showToast calls with postProgress calls (5%→20%→40%→45%→85%→90%→100%+checkmark)
- `GogDownloadManager.smali`: updated startDownload() signature to `(Context, GogGame, ProgressBar, TextView)`
- `GogGamesFragment$6.smali`: now View.OnClickListener; shows ProgressBar, disables button, calls updated startDownload()
- `GogGamesFragment$3.smali`: Install button in content, ProgressBar + status TextView added; setNegativeButton removed; dialog now [Launch][Close] only
- **Fix:** `const/4 v9, 0x8` → `const/16` — View.GONE=8 is out of const/4 range (-8 to 7)
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/GogDownloadManager$3.smali` (new)

### [fix] — v2.7.0-beta45 — Install button back in button bar; progress at top of dialog (2026-03-22)
**Commit:** `d7f6a3a`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.0-beta45
#### What changed
- Install button restored to AlertDialog button bar (setNegativeButton). Dialog stays open because after show() we call getButton(BUTTON_NEGATIVE) and set a new View.OnClickListener — this replaces AlertDialog's internal dismiss handler
- ProgressBar + status text inserted at indices 1 and 2 in content LinearLayout via addView(view, index) — always visible just below the title without scrolling
- GogGamesFragment$6 simplified: Button field removed (button is p1 in onClick), constructor is now (Context, GogGame, ProgressBar, TextView)
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/GogGamesFragment$3.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/GogGamesFragment$6.smali`

### [fix] — v2.7.1-pre-beta44 — Fix CDN manifest URL & separator; show appName on screen (2026-03-23)
**Commit:** `f49e8cc`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.1-pre-beta44  |  **Branch:** epic-integration (bannerhub-testing)
#### What changed
- `EpicInstallHelper.parseManifestDownloadUrl`: fixed inverted `if-nez` → `if-eqz` — first CDN query param no longer gets spurious `&` prefix, subsequent params now correctly separated with `&`. Was producing `?&Policy=XXXSignature=YYYKey-Pair-Id=ZZZ` (malformed CloudFront signed URL), causing Samorost 3 binary manifest download to fail with HTTP 0.
- `EpicMainActivity$7`: progress text changed from generic `"Fetching manifest info..."` to `"Fetching: {appName}"` — shows on screen whether catalog artifact name resolved (e.g. `Samorost3Game`) or is still library UUID.
#### Files touched
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/landscape/launcher/ui/menu/EpicInstallHelper.smali`

**Commit:** `fd39656`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.1-pre (retagged)
#### What changed
- Normal variant package changed from `gamehub.lite` → `banner.hub` (installs alongside official GameHub Lite)
- New `Normal(GHL)` variant added (`gamehub.lite`) for users replacing official GameHub Lite
- APK: `BannerHub-vX.Y.Z-Normal(GHL).apk`
- README: added Normal(GHL) row, added missing PuBG-CrossFire row, updated count 7→9, updated Which APK / FAQ
- CI: build-quick.yml unaffected (pre-release Normal already used banner.hub)

## v2.7.2-pre — GOG ported to side menu with bh-lite UI (2026-03-25)
- GOG tab removed from bottom navigation
- GOG now launches from side menu as a full Activity (identical to bh-lite)
- List / Grid / Poster 3-way view toggle
- SteamGridDB 600×900 cover art with GOG icon fallback
- Long-press on grid/poster tiles → detail dialog with HTML description
- GogGamesActivity, GogMainActivity, GogLoginActivity, GogDownloadManager, GogLaunchHelper compiled as Java (classes18.dex)
- All 29 GOG smali files removed
- CI: build-quick.yml (pre-release, Normal APK)

### [feat] — v2.7.3-pre — GOG install confirmation dialog with game size + free storage (2026-03-26)
**Commit:** `e13536c`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.3-pre  |  **CI:** ✅
#### What changed
- All 3 GOG install buttons (list inline, grid tile action row, grid/poster dialog) now show a confirmation dialog before starting any download
- Dialog shows: game title, game size (async-fetched), available storage on install path, Install / Cancel buttons
- Game size fetched in background: Gen 2 → builds → manifest → sum `depots[].size`; Gen 1 → `items[].total_size`; shows "Unknown" if unavailable
- ⚠ warning + red text if game size exceeds available storage
- `GogDownloadManager.fetchGameSize(ctx, game)` — 2 HTTP calls (builds + manifest), returns bytes or -1
- `GogDownloadManager.formatBytes(bytes)` — formats as KB / MB / GB
- `GogGamesActivity.showInstallConfirm(game, onConfirm)` — wraps all 3 install handlers
#### Files touched
- `extension/GogDownloadManager.java`
- `extension/GogGamesActivity.java`

### [feat] — v2.7.4-pre — Winlator HUD Style toggle in performance sidebar (2026-03-27)
**Commit:** `f2bd3a51c`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.4-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23647642646
#### What changed
- `BhFrameRating.java` (new): compact horizontal HUD bar — GPU% | CPU% | RAM% | BAT watts | TMP °C | FPS
  - GPU: kgsl/gpu_busy_percentage (Adreno) + Mali fallback
  - CPU: /proc/stat diff
  - RAM: ActivityManager.MemoryInfo
  - BAT: BatteryManager current × sysfs voltage
  - TMP: battery/thermal sysfs
  - FPS: ProfilePuller.a.a().c() via reflection
  - Injected into DecorView (TOP|RIGHT), tag "bh_frame_rating"; background thread, stops on detach
- `BhHudStyleSwitchListener.smali` (new): click handler — toggles BhFrameRating, hides GameHub hudLayer when Winlator HUD on
- `BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali` (updated): adds "Winlator HUD Style" SidebarSwitchItemView programmatically below Max Adreno Clocks; injects BhFrameRating into DecorView on first sidebar open
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhHudStyleSwitchListener.smali`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`

### [fix] — v2.7.5-pre — Winlator HUD: root cache, real FPS, drag (2026-03-27)
**Commit:** `b2500486d`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre
#### What changed
- Root dialog: `isRootAvailable()` now caches in static fields — su only runs once, no Magisk dialog on every sidebar open
- FPS was stuck at 1: `ProfilePuller.c()` returns GPU ratio (0-1), not FPS. Fixed to use `WineActivity.h.M()` (WinUIBridge) via reflection
- Drag support added to BhFrameRating via OnTouchListener — matches built-in HUD behaviour
- GPU: switched to `gpubusy` (busy/total format) as primary source — same path GameHub uses
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`

### [fix] — v2.7.5-pre (retag) — Root call removed, real FPS, drag (2026-03-27)
**Commit:** `bbe96a63d`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.5-pre (force-pushed)
#### What changed
- Sidebar never calls su again — reads `root_granted` from bh_prefs instead
- FPS source corrected: `WineActivity.j` (HudDataProvider) → `a()` — same data as GameHub HUD
- Drag support via OnTouchListener
- GPU reads `gpubusy` first
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhFrameRating.java`
- `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhPerfSetupDelegate.smali`

### [feat] — v2.7.6-pre — 3-way API selector: GameHub / EmuReady / BannerHub (2026-03-27)
**Commit:** `70376313a`  |  **Tag:** v2.7.6-pre
#### What changed
- Settings "Compatibility API" row cycles: GameHub (0) → EmuReady (1) → BannerHub (2) → back
- api_source int pref replaces use_external_api boolean
- BannerHub URL: `https://bannerhub-api.the412banner.workers.dev/`
- All isExternalAPI() call sites unchanged

### v2.8.1-pre — Launch tab in Wine Task Manager (2026-03-30)
**Commits:** `103fe1938` (feat), `21eff1a67` (fix)  |  **Tag:** v2.8.1-pre  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23757141474
#### What changed
- Added "Launch" tab (tabIndex=2) to BhTaskManagerFragment alongside Applications + Processes
- File browser rooted at WINEPREFIX: shows all drives (drive_c, drive_d, etc.)
- Directories shown yellow with ▶ prefix; .exe/.msi/.bat/.cmd shown white
- ↑ .. row for navigating up (hidden at wineRootPath)
- Tap launchable file → Toast "Launching: name" + Runtime.exec via wine binary
- Wine binary located by resolving /proc/<pid>/exe of running wineserver process
- Wine environment inherited from running .exe process /proc/<pid>/environ
- Fix: const/4 cannot encode 0x2f ('/' = 47); changed to const/16
#### Files touched
- `extension/BhWineLaunchHelper.java` (new)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhTaskManagerFragment.smali` (fields + showTab + onCreateView + browseTo)
- `patches/smali_classes16/.../BhFolderListener.smali` (new)

### v2.8.1-pre (fix2) — Launch binary fix + dosdevices default (2026-03-30)
**Commit:** `4afada69a`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.1-pre (retagged)  |  **CI:** ✅ run 23757835250
#### What changed
- findWineBinary(): read WINELOADER env var first (Wine always sets this) — was failing silently because binary isn't named wine64/wine
- Fallback scan now tries: wine64, wine, wineloader, wine64-preloader
- launchExe() now takes Context and shows error Toast if binary not found
- BhInitLaunchRunnable: opens at WINEPREFIX/dosdevices (c:, d:, z: drive letters) instead of WINEPREFIX root

### [fix] — v2.8.2-pre6 — Epic install size sanity check (2026-04-01)
**Commit:** `7b0b3e207`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2-pre6
#### What changed
- EpicGamesActivity.loadCachedGames(): after optLong("installSize"), discard any value > 1 TB (1_099_511_627_776 bytes) and reset to 0
- Fixes Dreamscaper (and any other game) showing e.g. "7516192768.00 GB" due to a stale/corrupt long in bh_epic_prefs
#### Files touched
- extension/EpicGamesActivity.java

### [polish] — v2.8.2-pre7 — UI polish: all 3 store screens (2026-04-01)
**Commit:** `f110010ec`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2-pre7
#### What changed

### [fix] — v2.8.2-pre8 — compile fix for GogGamesActivity curly quotes (2026-04-01)
**Commit:** `193f3aa75`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.2-pre8
#### What changed
- Replaced literal " and " Unicode curly quote chars with \u201c/\u201d escape sequences
- Same pattern Epic/Amazon already used; GOG was missed causing javac ')' expected error
#### Files touched
- extension/GogGamesActivity.java

### [stable] — v2.8.3 — Extra Detailed HUD + controller nav (2026-04-02)
**Commit:** `bba9c10b7`  |  **Tag:** v2.8.3
#### What changed
- Extra Detailed HUD (BhDetailedHud) — replaces Normal HUD when Winlator HUD + Extra Detailed checkbox both enabled
  - Metrics: FPS+graph (spanning both rows in horizontal), CPU%, GPU%, RAM, SWAP used/total GB, CPU/GPU/BAT temps
  - Horizontal layout: column-group design with solid vertical dividers; vertical layout: one row per metric
  - Opacity slider works for both HUDs; text shadow/halo at <10% and <30% opacity
  - Extra Detailed checkbox disabled/grayed when Winlator HUD is off
  - BhHudInjector.injectOrUpdate() as single source of truth for all HUD visibility
  - Shadow clipping fix: setClipChildren/setClipToPadding(false) on all container LinearLayouts
- Controller D-pad navigation highlights on all store cards (GOG/Epic/Amazon) — all 3 view modes, A-button confirm
- README.md updated with Extra Detailed HUD section

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit 8d5fa95e1) — Fix KonkrHud BAT gap + width
**Root cause:** `makeBatRowView()` used `LinearLayout.LayoutParams(width=0, weight=0)` for the BAT label. With `setClipChildren(false)` on the batRow, the label rendered outside its bounds at the wrong Y position — causing a ~150px visual gap between SWAP and BAT rows. Also `dp(200)` was too wide (350px vs reference ~190px).
**Fix:** Replaced weighted batRow with solid blue full-row (same as RAM/SWAP). Reduced width: dp(200) → dp(120).
**Files:** `extension/BhKonkrHud.java`
**CI:** ✅ run 23920120008

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit 96cf0c658) — Fix KonkrHud opacity slider
**Root cause:** `BhHudOpacityListener.onProgressChanged()` iterated BhFrameRating + BhDetailedHud calling `applyBackgroundOpacity()` but BhKonkrHud was never added to the list — opacity changes had no effect until a layout rebuild (orientation toggle).
**Fix:** Added `:try_konkr` block after `:try_detailed` in BhHudOpacityListener — findViewWithTag("bh_konkr_hud") → cast → applyBackgroundOpacity(progress). No new locals needed.
**Files:** `patches/smali_classes16/com/xj/winemu/sidebar/BhHudOpacityListener.smali`
**CI:** ✅ run 23921454575

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit a4e386766) — Fix KonkrHud SKN zone scan range
**Root cause:** `readSkinTemp()` scanned zones 0-29. On this device (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / PM8550), skin thermal zones are at zone53 (`xo-therm`) and zone55 (`skin-msm-therm`) — both outside the old limit. Type names already matched search patterns. FAN "---" is correct (no physical fan on device).
**Fix:** `z < 30` → `z < 80`
**Files:** `extension/BhKonkrHud.java`
**CI:** ✅ run 23921860855

---
### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit f7c2734ae) — Fix KonkrHud fan RPM reading
**Root cause:** `readFanSpeed()` scanned `i < 10`. AYANEO Konkr's `pwm-fan` is at cooling_device38 (type="pwm-fan"). RPM is at `/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon0/fan1_input` (currently 4042 RPM).
**Fix:** Read hwmon fan1_input directly first; fallback scan expanded to i<50.
**Files:** `extension/BhKonkrHud.java`
**CI:** ✅ run 23922246076

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit ff674099e) — Fix GPU% fallback path
**Root cause:** All 3 GPU% paths use `vendor_sysfs_kgsl` SELinux context — enforcing-denied on some devices → returns 0. `/sys/kernel/gpu/gpu_busy` has less restricted context on many devices (Exynos + others).
**Fix:** Added `/sys/kernel/gpu/gpu_busy` fallback before Mali path. CPU% has no alternative to `/proc/stat` without root.
**Files:** `extension/BhKonkrHud.java`
**CI:** ✅ run 23924627987

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.4-pre (commit af8598845) — Fix GPU temp fallback paths
**Root cause:** GPU thermal zones (gpuss-0..7) at zones 41-48, beyond old z<20 scan. kgsl/kgsl-3d0/temp works on Qualcomm but fails on other devices. CPU temp fine (cpuss-0 at zone 10, within z<20).
**Fix:** Add /sys/kernel/gpu/gpu_tmu as secondary fallback; expand thermal zone scan z<20→z<80.
**Files:** `extension/BhKonkrHud.java`
**CI:** ✅ run 23925038629

### 2026-04-02 — v2.8.5-pre (commit a6b41664a) — Touch button scale cap raised to 300%
**Issue:** #35 — scale slider capped at 150% despite system supporting higher values.
**Fix:** `patches/res/layout/control_element_settings.xml` — SBScale `valueTo` 150→300.
**CI:** ⏳ run 23926822469

### 2026-04-03 — v2.8.7-pre1 — Per-game settings Export/Import Config
**Feature:** Users can share game configs via JSON. "Export Config" saves `pc_g_setting<id>` SP to `/sdcard/BannerHub/configs/<gamename>-<devicename>.json`. "Import Config" lists available files and applies selected one's settings to the current game.
**Access:** Two new options in the game "..." settings menu (My Games → long-press → settings).
**Files:** `extension/BhSettingsExporter.java`, `patches/smali/…/BhExportLambda.smali`, `patches/smali/…/BhImportLambda.smali`, both CI workflows (new smali patch step).
**CI:** ⏳ run 23953526581

**Commit:** `72fd37b16`  |  **Tag:** v2.9.4-pre  |  **CI:** run 24376232793 ✅
#### What changed
- `BhSettingsExporter.java`: added `meta.put("app_source", "bannerhub")` to every exported config JSON
- Allows community backend to filter/purge BannerHub vs BannerHub Lite configs
- Companion change in BH-Lite exports `"bannerhub_lite"` — same field, different value
#### Files touched

### [feat] — v3.0.4-pre — Cloud Saves GOG + Epic (2026-04-14)
**Commit:** `bf80e9c8b`  |  **Tag:** v3.0.4-pre

#### What changed
- **GOG-1 Cloud Saves**: `GogCloudSaveManager.java` — upload (newer-wins comparison) + download to/from `cloudstorage.gog.com/v1/{userId}/{gameId}`; auto-refreshes GOG access token before calls
- **EPIC-2 Cloud Saves**: `EpicCloudSaveManager.java` — POST writeLink + PUT for upload, GET readLink for download; auto-refreshes Epic token via `EpicAuthClient.refreshToken()`
- **FolderPickerActivity**: In-app folder browser starting at `getFilesDir()`; shows subdirs only; "Select this folder" returns absolute path
- **GogGameDetailActivity**: CLOUD SAVES section now live — Browse button → FolderPickerActivity; Upload/Download buttons with live status line; prefs key `gog_save_dir_{gameId}`
- **EpicGameDetailActivity**: Same cloud saves section for Epic; prefs key `epic_save_dir_{appName}`
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: FolderPickerActivity registered

### [docs+triage] — README badges expansion + issue triage sweep (2026-05-14)
**Commits:** `aba0fbb` (feature branch), `67d10f2` (badges → main), `378c0e3` (latest-release link → main), `4467ce9` (for-the-badge upsize → main)

#### README changes
- Added two GitHub downloads badges (total + latest-release) alongside the existing Discord badge in the H1 header
- Upsized all three to `for-the-badge` style, centered in a `<p align="center">` block matching the bannerhub-revanced layout
- Added `📥 Latest stable: v3.7.2` link below the badge row, pointing at `/releases/latest` (auto-redirects, so URL never needs updating — only the visible vX.Y.Z text changes per release)
- Layout now mirrors bannerhub-revanced and Bannerhub-Lite (all three repos standardized same day)

#### Issue triage — 10 open → 6 open
| # | Title | Action |
|---|---|---|
| #77 | Integrar a geração de frames (PT — feature request) | Closed completed — frame-gen shipped in v3.7.0, replied bilingually with link to latest release |
| #78 | Launcher Support Assistance (SWG launcher) | Closed completed — user already had a workaround; provided cleaner alternative (vcredist2019 + vcredist2022 + mono + gecko on Wine 10 / Proton 9 container) |
| #86 | button editor (port macros + per-button transparency from 6.0) | Closed not-planned — 6.0 on-screen-controls subsystem was rewritten between 5.3.5 and 6.0, apktool smali patching can't realistically retrofit it; pointed user at bannerhub-revanced which has both features natively |
| #65 | No SD Card found (Xiaomi MIUI + RP5) | Closed completed — split into two scenarios (toggle scope clarification + MIUI "All Files Access" upgrade permission path) |
| #87 | Frame generation not working | Replied + left open — gave 3-step triage (chipset check for VK_NV_optical_flow, imagefs ≥1.3.5, Mesa Turnip driver not stock blob); awaiting user device info |
| #85 | Fails to launch under x64 with most translators | Replied + left open — solid 4-device repro (RP5/AYN Thor/Tab S7+/S20), confirmed by 2nd user; requested logcat + exhaustive Box64 version list. Box64-0.4.1-2 confirmed working as workaround |
| #84 | Direct Launch broken from ES-DE/Beacons | Replied + left open — user already pin-pointed `DeepLinkRouterActivity` + `getLastLaunchType` returning invalid game id; need to confirm which app (Lite vs main) + exact intent string before backend fix |

#### Still open (untouched this pass)
- #56 permissions not visible (cosmetic Android UI — user handled themselves)
- #63 components not deleting (video evidence on inaccessible Discord — needs re-upload)
- #48 Settings auto-null when selecting Proton 9 with Box64/FEX (has folder-swap workaround — refreshWineDependent logic to fix)


### [feat+diag+port] — GOG download reliability overhaul (2026-05-14)
**Branch:** `feature/gog-toast-diagnostic`
**Commits (chronological):** `2cad8d8` → `2f80578` → `974508f` → `bbc04b5` → `1ba5a44` → `20f6f96`

User reported a POSTAL 2 (GOG id 1207658755) download failing with toast "Download failed: no depot array in the manifest". Debug log analysis revealed the real cause was 2 of 1475 files refusing all retries on Fastly CDN (`Paradise Lost/Animations/ED_WeaponsToo.ukx`, `hart.ukx`); the gen1 fallback's "no depot array" message was misleading. Session work split into three layers — diagnostic visibility, UX recovery, and an actual fix ported from GameNative.

#### Layer 1: Diagnostic toast + dbg log (`2cad8d8`, `2f80578`)
- `runGen2` now tracks failed relative paths in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue
- On gen2-files-failed-but-gen1-also-failed, toast prefers gen2's file-level message over gen1's misleading parser error
- Toast text shortened to ~52 chars to fit Android toast width: `Download failed: 2/1475 files (ED_WeaponsToo.ukx +1)`
- Toast text now also written to `bh_gog_debug.txt` as `toast=...` line on every error path

#### Layer 2: Unified install-state model with PARTIAL recovery (`974508f`)
- `extension/GogInstallPath.java` extended with `State` enum (INSTALLED / PARTIAL / NONE) + 4 helpers (`checkState`, `markPartial`, `clearPartial`, `clearAll`, `getInstallOrPartialPath`)
- `BhDownloadService.runGog` writes `gog_partial_<id>` SharedPref at download start, clears on `onComplete`/`onCancelled`, leaves on `onError`
- All 3 download-trigger UIs (`GogGameDetailActivity`, `GogGamesActivity` list / grid / dialog) and the inline `uninstall()` helper updated to use the shared state helper
- PARTIAL state shows "Resume install" + Uninstall buttons (existing resume logic skips files already on disk; Uninstall wipes partial folder + clears prefs)
- Survives app restart — process death mid-download leaves uninstallable state in SharedPrefs

#### Layer 3: Multi-CDN download port from GameNative (`20f6f96`)
After the diagnostic build (run `25867736845`) shipped `974508f` and the same user re-tested on `feature/gog-toast-diagnostic` device build, the new log `bh_gog_debug (1).txt` confirmed the hypothesis: 4 of 1475 files failed same-CDN retries (worse than before — same chunks blocked at Fastly edge). Ported 4 GameNative commits from `utkarshdalal/GameNative`:

- **`extension/BhCdnHelper.java` (new)** — Java port of GameNative `CdnRankingUtils.kt` (PR #1220, Utkarsh Dalal). `probeAndRank()` for future picker UI; `rankByLatency()` for download path. Treats response 200..499 as reachable.
- `parseCdnUrl(String) → String` replaced with `parseCdnUrls(String) → List<String>` — parses ALL secure_link.urls[] entries, not just first
- New `appendPathBeforeQuery(base, path)` helper — Bart Zaalberg's URL builder from PR #1215. Handles trailing slashes + token-in-query-string preservation
- `runGen2` HEAD-probe ranks CDNs at download start (1500ms per probe), captures ranked list, retries cycle through different CDNs: `attempt N → fCdnBases.get((attempt-1) % cdnCount)`
- Max attempts auto-scaled to `min(6, max(3, 2 × cdnCount))` so each CDN gets at least one shot when multiple are available
- Backoff capped at 8s (was uncapped exponential)
- RETRY/FAIL log lines now include `cdn=<hostname>` so dbg traces show whether failures clustered on one edge or spanned multiple

Credits doc: `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md` (commit `bbc04b5`, statuses flipped to ✅ Ported at `20f6f96`). All 4 contributors named with verified commit URLs + PR links.

#### Build artifacts
- `25867736845` — diagnostic build (Layers 1+2), device-confirmed hypothesis on PuBG variant
- `25872444614` — multi-CDN build (all 3 layers), 135 MB Normal variant signed with debug key. Side-installs over existing v3.7.2 — version string shows `feature/gog-toast-diagnostic`.

#### Verification (PuBG variant `com.tencent.ig`)
Read via `getlog --cat /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.tencent.ig/files/bh_gog_debug.txt` after install — Citadel Remonstered (468 files) downloaded cleanly with new diagnostic lines:
- `cdn_bases_raw=2: [fastly_url, gcdn.co_url]` — multi-URL parser working
- `cdn_bases_ranked=2: [fastly, gcdn.co]` — HEAD probe + rank working
- `gen2 download complete: 468 files OK` — no regression on success path
- Fallback-to-second-CDN behavior not exercised (Fastly served all 468 cleanly), so confirmation of fallback awaits POSTAL 2 user retry

#### Open follow-ups
- CDN picker UI on same branch (Auto default + per-CDN options with latency badges + power-user pin-a-specific-CDN)
- POSTAL 2 user retest with the multi-CDN build to confirm `ED_WeaponsToo.ukx` / `hart.ukx` now succeed on a non-Fastly retry
- When ready for stable: rebase + cherry-pick port commits to a clean main-targeted PR (the current branch carries the diagnostic + install-state + port commits and is debug-key-signed)

### [feat+merge+pre-release] — GOG download overhaul lands on main, v3.7.3-pre1 dispatched (2026-05-14)
**Merge commit:** `a477165` on `main` (--no-ff, preserves 9-commit feature history `2cad8d8` → `03879dc`)  |  **Tag:** `v3.7.3-pre1`  |  **Build:** [run 25876297190](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25876297190) dispatched on tag ref (workflow_dispatch — no auto-release per `!v*-pre*` filter, matches pre-release policy)

#### Follow-up commits past the previous entry's range
- `ed50688 feat(gog): CDN picker UI in install-confirm dialog` — `BhInstallConfirmDialog.java` gains a CDN selector. Default is **Auto** (rank-by-latency, current behavior); user can pin a specific CDN by hostname. Per-CDN options show latency badges from `BhCdnHelper.probeAndRank`.
- `03879dc feat(gog): ↻ Refresh button on CDN picker` — user-triggered re-probe of CDN latency from the picker UI without re-opening the dialog. Useful when network conditions shift between the initial dialog open and the install confirm.

#### Device confirmations (user-reported 2026-05-14)
- ✅ **POSTAL 2** download now completes with multi-CDN fallback — the empirical confirmation that the port resolves the original Fastly chunk-refusal blocker
- ✅ **CDN picker UI** works as intended
- ✅ **↻ Refresh button** works as intended

#### Merge mechanics
- `feature/gog-toast-diagnostic` was already current with `origin/main` (merge-base = `a691194`, the main HEAD) → clean `--no-ff` merge
- 9 files changed, +988 / −114; new `extension/BhCdnHelper.java` + `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md`
- All 5 feature commits (`2cad8d8`, `20f6f96`, `974508f`, `ed50688`, `03879dc`) verified reachable from `origin/main` post-push

#### Pre-release build mechanics (why tag + dispatch, not just dispatch)
`build.yml` strips the `v` prefix from `GITHUB_REF_NAME` and uses the remainder as the injected `versionName`. Dispatching directly on `main` would bake `versionName: main` into the APK. Tagging first then dispatching on the tag ref bakes `versionName: 3.7.3-pre1` correctly. The tag-push trigger is filtered by `!v*-pre*` so the tag alone won't auto-build — explicit `workflow_dispatch --ref v3.7.3-pre1` is the artifact-only path that matches the pre-release policy.

#### Outstanding before v3.7.3 stable
- User device-tests `v3.7.3-pre1` artifact across variants
- Credits doc `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md` status fields bump to `🚀 Shipped in v3.7.3` + `📱 device-confirmed 2026-05-14`
- Release notes call out the 4 upstream `utkarshdalal/GameNative` contributors per the credits doc — Utkarsh Dalal (#1220, #1219), Bart Zaalberg (#1215), Joshua Tam (#1277), co-author Jeremy Bernstein (#1219)
- `BANNERHUB_MASTER_MAP.md` update per the master-map-on-every-release rule

### [fix+policy] — build.yml release job gated to push events only (2026-05-14)
**Issue:** Dispatching `build.yml` via `gh workflow run --ref v3.7.3-pre1` produced an auto-created GitHub Release "Bannerhub v3.7.3-pre1" (deleted), violating the pre-release policy that says all pre-tagged builds are artifact-only until the user says "stable" again.

**Root cause:** The `release:` job (line 782) had no `if:` guard. The tag-push trigger's `!v*-pre*` filter only blocks auto-firing the workflow from a pre-tag push — it doesn't prevent the release job from running when the workflow is dispatched manually.

**Fix:** Added `if: github.event_name == 'push'` to the release job. Auto-publish a GitHub Release only on tag PUSH events (which are already filtered to stable tags by the top-level `push.tags` rules). `workflow_dispatch` never creates releases, regardless of which ref it targets.

**Cleanup:** Deleted the v3.7.3-pre1 GitHub Release via `gh release delete`. The tag `v3.7.3-pre1` is kept as the build anchor (commit `a477165`); the build's APK artifacts remain on workflow run [25876297190](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25876297190).

### [session-bookmark] — 2026-05-14 EOD state — awaiting device test on two independent artifacts

Two artifacts sit on workflow run pages awaiting user device test before v3.7.3 stable can ship. Both are independent and can be tested in any order.

#### Artifact 1 — v3.7.3-pre1 (all 9 variants)
- **Run:** [25876297190](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25876297190) ✅
- **From:** main `a477165` (the GOG overhaul merge commit)
- **Tag:** `v3.7.3-pre1` (preserved as build anchor; the accidentally-auto-created Release was deleted)
- **Contents:** GOG download reliability overhaul — multi-CDN port from upstream `utkarshdalal/GameNative` + CDN picker UI + ↻ Refresh button + install-state PARTIAL recovery + diagnostic toast
- **Already device-confirmed (2026-05-14):** POSTAL 2 multi-CDN fallback, Citadel Remonstered 468/468 clean, CDN picker UI, ↻ Refresh button
- **What's left to test:** broader variant validation if user wants — but the core fix is already user-validated

#### Artifact 2 — fix/framegen-onresume (Normal variant only)
- **Run:** [25877838030](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25877838030) ✅
- **From:** branch `fix/framegen-onresume@cc15e56` (NOT merged to main yet)
- **Origin:** port of [Bannerhub-Lite PR #5 by teldommm](https://github.com/The412Banner/Bannerhub-Lite/pull/5)
- **Contents:** Two bug fixes (FrameGen re-apply on resume + gear visibility tied to switch state) + dialog cleanup (translucent dim background replaces solid black, multiplier picker removed, in-dialog Enable switch removed, Close button KEPT per user request)
- **7-step test plan:**
  1. Enable FrameGen → gear appears, overlay activates
  2. Press Home / resume → overlay still active (was: silently dead)
  3. Open dialog → game visible behind 60% dim (was: full-screen black)
  4. Dialog has only Preset slider + flowScale slider + Close button
  5. Tap-outside dismisses + Close button dismisses
  6. Toggle switch OFF → gear hides immediately
  7. Toggle switch ON → gear reappears immediately

#### If both pass → cut v3.7.3 stable
1. Merge `fix/framegen-onresume` to main (likely `--no-ff` to preserve the 2-commit history) — bundles framegen fix into v3.7.3
2. Bump status in `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md`: `🚀 Shipped in v3.7.3` + `📱 device-confirmed 2026-05-14`
3. Update `BANNERHUB_MASTER_MAP.md` per the master-map-on-every-release rule
4. Tag `v3.7.3` (no `-pre`) → triggers `build.yml` tag-push → auto-creates the stable Release per the now-guarded release job
5. Release notes call out the 4 upstream `utkarshdalal/GameNative` contributors (Utkarsh Dalal #1220 #1219, Bart Zaalberg #1215, Joshua Tam #1277, co-author Jeremy Bernstein #1219) + teldommm for the framegen fix
6. Pre-release policy resumes after the stable

#### If anything fails → diagnose on-device
- Use logcat-bridge via `getlog <pkg>` for any crash/log capture
- Push fixes to whichever branch; rebuild via `gh workflow run`
- Memory shortcuts: [[bannerhub-gog-download-stack-state]] for GOG; [[bannerhub-framegen-onresume-fix-branch-state]] for framegen

### [fix] — FrameGen: re-apply on resume + gear-visible-only-when-ON (2026-05-14)
**Branch:** `fix/framegen-onresume` (off main `cb7b9cc`)  |  **Ported from:** [Bannerhub-Lite PR #5 by teldommm](https://github.com/The412Banner/Bannerhub-Lite/pull/5)

#### Bugs being fixed
1. **FrameGen settings dropped on resume.** `BhFrameGenWriter.applyFromPrefsNoContext()` was only called from `WineActivity.onCreate` (`patches/smali_classes15/com/xj/winemu/WineActivity.smali` line 6052). After app suspension, resuming the game never re-wrote `gamescope.control` bytes — sidebar switch showed "enabled" but the AI overlay was inactive.
2. **Gear button always visible.** `patches/res/layout/winemu_sidebar_controls_fragment.xml` had no `android:visibility` on `btn_frame_gen_settings`, and `BhFrameGenWiring.bind()` unconditionally called `setVisibility(View.VISIBLE)`. Gear remained visible even with the FrameGen switch OFF — inconsistent with the RTS gesture button pattern in the same sidebar.

#### Changes
- `patches/smali_classes15/com/xj/winemu/WineActivity.smali` — added one `invoke-static` after `invoke-super` in `onResume()V` (line 8679 anchor). Uses the Context-accepting `applyFromPrefs(Landroid/content/Context;)V` variant per the PR; passes `p0`. No `.locals` change needed.
- `patches/res/layout/winemu_sidebar_controls_fragment.xml` — added `android:visibility="gone"` on `btn_frame_gen_settings` (line 22).
- `extension/BhFrameGenWiring.java` — `bind()` now resolves both gear + switch first, then ties gear visibility to switch state in two places: initial bind (mirrors loaded `settings.enabled`) and switch click handler (mirrors new state). Idempotent; safe to call on every onResume.

#### Why we don't need a workflow change like the upstream PR
The upstream PR adds a Python-based smali injection to `build-bhapi.yml`. BannerHub's framegen WineActivity hook is *not* applied via workflow patching — it lives as a static pre-edited file in `patches/smali_classes15/com/xj/winemu/WineActivity.smali` that `cp -r patches/. apktool_out_base/` overlays. Adding the onResume `invoke-static` line directly to that static file is the BannerHub-native equivalent — no Python step, no workflow change.

#### Dialog cleanup (also ported from PR #5, with one deviation)
After user approval, the rest of the PR's dialog cleanup was ported in a follow-up commit on the same branch. The dialog now mirrors Bannerhub-Lite's simplified surface EXCEPT for the Close button, which BannerHub keeps so users have multiple ways to dismiss the dialog (tap-outside + visible Close).

- `extension/BhFrameGenDialog.java`:
  - Window: solid black background dropped; replaced with `FLAG_DIM_BEHIND` + `dimAmount = 0.6f` + transparent background. Panel gets 16dp top/bottom margins.
  - Removed in-dialog "Enable frame generation" Switch — sidebar switch is the single source of truth for on/off state.
  - Removed the multiplier (2x/3x/4x) RadioGroup — multiplier hardcoded to 2x in the writer.
  - Sections renumbered (1: Preset slider, 2: flowScale slider).
  - Removed unused `RadioButton`/`RadioGroup`/`Switch` imports and the `clampMultiplier` helper.
  - **KEPT (deviation from PR):** the blue "Close" button at the bottom of the panel. User explicitly requested multiple dismissal paths.
- `extension/BhFrameGenSettings.java`: `multiplier` field removed along with its load/save lines.
- `extension/BhFrameGenWriter.java`: byte 9 now hardcoded to `2` in `write()`; `writeMultiplier()` method removed. `clampInt` helper retained to match the upstream PR (still used by the broader writer surface if extended later).

#### Test plan (device)
1. Enable FrameGen in sidebar → gear button appears, overlay activates
2. Exit + re-enter game → overlay remains active (was: dropped on resume)
3. Disable FrameGen → gear button disappears immediately (was: stayed visible)
4. Re-enable → gear reappears immediately
5. Open the gear dialog → game stays visible behind a 60% dim layer (was: solid black). Three controls only: Preset slider, flowScale slider, Close button. Tap-outside also dismisses.

### [stable] — v3.7.3 — GOG download reliability overhaul + FrameGen resume fix (2026-05-14)

Stable release bundling the two device-confirmed fixes that landed during the 2026-05-14 session.

#### Merge mechanics
- `fix/framegen-onresume@cc15e56` merged into `main` with `--no-ff` → merge commit `c884fab`. 2-commit feature history (`7d192cf` + `cc15e56`) preserved.
- One merge conflict in `PROGRESS_LOG.md` (both branches appended different entries past line 4855) — resolved by keeping the framegen `[fix]` block alongside main's `[fix+policy]` + `[session-bookmark]` entries.
- `feature/gog-toast-diagnostic` was already merged to main earlier in the session (`a477165`, the GOG overhaul merge commit) and shipped as the v3.7.3-pre1 artifact ([run 25876297190](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25876297190)).

#### Bundled into v3.7.3
1. **GOG download reliability overhaul** (already on main since `a477165`) — multi-CDN port from `utkarshdalal/GameNative` + CDN picker UI + ↻ Refresh button + install-state PARTIAL recovery + diagnostic toast. Ports 4 upstream PRs (Utkarsh Dalal #1220 #1219, Bart Zaalberg #1215, Joshua Tam #1277, co-author Jeremy Bernstein #1219). Device-confirmed on POSTAL 2 (multi-CDN fallback) + Citadel Remonstered (468/468).
2. **FrameGen onResume + gear visibility + dialog cleanup** (this merge) — port of Bannerhub-Lite PR #5 by teldommm. Re-apply on `WineActivity.onResume`, gear visibility tied to switch state, translucent dialog dim, multiplier picker + in-dialog Enable switch removed (Close button kept).

#### Release-prep updates
- `README.md` — latest-stable badge bumped to v3.7.3; FrameGen dialog table updated (multiplier picker + Enable toggle rows removed); persistence note now mentions both onCreate + onResume hooks; new "Multi-CDN failover (v3.7.3+)" paragraph in the GOG Download Pipeline section.
- `BANNERHUB_MASTER_MAP.md` — added v3.7.3 patch blockquote in § AI-FrameGen (3 changes: onResume re-apply, gear visibility, dialog cleanup with byte 9 hardcoded to 2) and in §22 GOG Download System (5 changes: multi-CDN, picker, refresh, PARTIAL state, diagnostic toast).
- `release_notes.txt` — full v3.7.3 body written matching v3.7.2 style (warnings + "What's new" + upgrading + credits), with explicit attribution to all 4 upstream GameNative contributors + teldommm.
- `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md` — status bump to `🚀 Shipped in v3.7.3` + `📱 device-confirmed 2026-05-14` pending the final docs commit below.

#### Tag + release
- Single docs commit on main: README + master map + PROGRESS_LOG + release notes + credits status bump.
- Annotated tag `v3.7.3` on the docs commit.
- Push commit + tag → `build.yml` push trigger fires for all 9 variants; the now-guarded `release:` job (gated by `if: github.event_name == 'push'`) auto-creates the GitHub Release with the APKs attached.
- Manual `gh release edit v3.7.3 --notes-file release_notes.txt` after the workflow completes (softprops/action-gh-release@v2 doesn't read body_path from the workflow as currently wired).

#### Outstanding (post-tag)
- After build completes: edit the GitHub Release body with `release_notes.txt` content.
- Memory updates: bump BannerHub master state to "v3.7.3 shipped 2026-05-14"; mark the framegen-onresume + GOG memories as SHIPPED; clear the stale v3.6.0-disclaimers memory (already shipped, never carried over).
- Pre-release policy resumes after this stable.

### [ship] — v3.7.3 stable shipped end-to-end (2026-05-14)

All post-tag outstanding items completed.

#### Build outcome
- [run 25879637817](https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/actions/runs/25879637817) ✅ — `prepare` + 9 variant builds + `release` job all green.
- 9 APK assets attached: `BannerHub-v3.7.3-{Normal, Normal.GHL, PuBG, PuBG-CrossFire, AnTuTu, alt-AnTuTu, Ludashi, Genshin, Original}.apk`.
- Release auto-created with `isPrerelease=false` because the tag has no `-` suffix (softprops/action-gh-release@v2's `prerelease: ${{ contains(steps.tag.outputs.name, '-') }}` evaluates `false` for `v3.7.3`). The `if: github.event_name == 'push'` guard on the release job (workflow fix `215f044`) did its job — only the tag push reached the release step.

#### Release body upload
- `gh release edit v3.7.3 --notes-file release_notes.txt --latest -R The412Banner/BannerHub` succeeded.
- Release URL: https://github.com/The412Banner/BannerHub/releases/tag/v3.7.3
- Marked as the repository's latest release (passes the `> github.com/.../releases/latest` redirect that Obtainium + the README badge follow).

#### Memory updates (per [[memory-update-workflow]])
- `project_bannerhub.md` — current state section rewritten to "v3.7.3 SHIPPED 2026-05-14", with merge SHAs, tag commit `58f270a`, build run, release URL, and a note that pre-release policy resumes.
- `project_bannerhub_gog_download.md` — frontmatter description updated to "SHIPPED in v3.7.3"; status summary line `🚀 SHIPPED in v3.7.3 stable 2026-05-14` added.
- `project_bannerhub_framegen_onresume_fix.md` — frontmatter updated; "Pending decisions" section replaced with "Outcome — all 7 test steps passed 2026-05-14"; memory now frozen as a build-record reference.
- `MEMORY.md` index — 3 lines rewritten to reflect SHIPPED state; stale `project_bannerhub_pending_stable_disclaimers.md` entry removed (file deleted — all v3.6.0 disclaimers already shipped, nothing carried over).
- `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md` (in-repo, shipped as part of `58f270a`) — all 4 piece Status fields bumped to `🚀 Shipped in v3.7.3 (2026-05-14) — 📱 device-confirmed 2026-05-14`; the top-level "✅ PORTED" header rewritten to "🚀 SHIPPED"; the stale "Next step / Awaiting" lines removed.

#### Pre-release policy resumes
Per [[BannerHub-pre-release-policy]], all builds from this point are pre-release artifact-only (no GH Release) until user says "stable" again. The next pre-tag push will produce APK artifacts on the workflow run page only, never a GitHub Release.

#### Credits surface
Release body credits the four upstream `utkarshdalal/GameNative` contributors (Utkarsh Dalal #1220 + #1219, Bart Zaalberg #1215, Joshua Tam #1277, co-author Jeremy Bernstein #1219) and [teldommm](https://github.com/teldommm) for the FrameGen onResume fix (Bannerhub-Lite PR #5). The `gamehub_reports/GAMENATIVE_GOG_PORT_CREDITS.md` doc in the repo is the canonical attribution record.

## 2026-05-15 — fix(vibration): preload-free winebus patch — removes libevshim, fixes x86-64/box64 launch death

Branch `fix/vibration-preload-free` off `main`. Supersedes the interim `fix/evshim-box64-guard` (kept as a fallback).

**Why:** v3.7.0's `libevshim.so` was LD_PRELOAD'd into every Wine subprocess; its in-memory winebus GOT/.bss patcher `mprotect`'d + rewrote the *guest* x86_64 `winebus.so` while box64's dynarec was JIT-translating it → translation-cache corruption → every x86-64/box64 game launch CPU-spun ~60 s then the wine process died. Root-caused 2026-05-15 from device logs (`com.tencent.ig`, Dead Cells, Proton 10 x64, Box64-0.4.1-2). arm64x/FEX unaffected.

**Fix (ported from GameNative PR #1214 / TideGear `GameHub-Vibration-Fix`, with the author's explicit permission — same lineage BannerHub's evshim already credited):** drop the LD_PRELOAD/libevshim approach entirely; instead statically patch `winebus.so`'s SDL duration loads on disk (aarch64 + x86_64) so SDL2's ~1 s rumble auto-expiry never fires. No extra `.so` mapped into Wine → the crash class is eliminated AND rumble works on box64.

Changes:
- `extension/BhVibrationController.java` → replaced with the preload-free version (adds `ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(Context)`; same package `com.xj.winemu.vibration` + identical prefs constants → drop-in). `BhVibrationSettingsActivity.java` byte-identical, untouched.
- `scripts/patch_winebus_rumble_duration.py` added (offline winebus patch util).
- `build-quick.yml` + `build.yml`: removed the "Build libevshim.so" step; **Patch 3 rewritten** from "prepend libevshim.so to LD_PRELOAD" → call `BhVibrationController.ensureWinebusDurationPatchOnce(ctx)` at the same env-builder anchor (Context at `p0->a`, fires once pre-launch, self-gates repeat scans, no LD_PRELOAD changes). onRumble/dispatchToController/onStop hooks unchanged.
- `native/evshim/evshim.c` now unused (no build step); left in tree (reversible).

Pre-release per policy ([[feedback_bannerhub_prerelease]]). Quick CI dispatched on the branch; full `build.yml` needed for the PuBG-variant device test (`com.tencent.ig`, Dead Cells on the x86-64/Box64 container — the failing config). Validate winebus byte patterns against BannerHub's proton10/11+box64 winebus.so; `winebus_dump_x86_64.so` fallback covers a pattern miss. See memory `project_bannerhub_evshim_box64_regression` + `reference_gamehub_vibration_fix_preloadfree`.
